## Data resource
### [DementiaBank](https://dementia.talkbank.org/access/)
We use the dataset used in the competition and the tags on it to classify the MCI and AD classes in all of the patients.
### [TED-LIUM release1](https://huggingface.co/datasets/LIUM/tedlium)
We use the dataset composed of Ted Talks in 2012. The reason we chose it is because of the fluency of the speaker's speech and the length of the speech, which is suitable for the patient dataset.

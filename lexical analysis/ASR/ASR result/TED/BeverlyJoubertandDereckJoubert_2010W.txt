 thousand kills by these amazing animals, but one of the things that science really lets us down on is that personality that that individual personality that these animals have and Here's a priming sample. We found the slipper in a 2000 year old bear bear tree in Africa and the same tree that we found her mother in and her grandmother and She took us on a journey and Revealed something very special to us her own daughter eight days old and The minute we found the slipper we realized that we needed to move in and so we basically stayed with the slipper for the next four and a half years Following her every day getting to know her that individual personality of hers and really coming to know her now I'm destined to spend a lot of time with some unique very very special individualistic and often seductive female characters Beverly's clearly one of them and This little leopard Lackadama is another and she changed our lives Well, we certainly did spend a lot of time with her and in fact more time than even another did when a hundred girls Hunting we would stay and form and early on a lightning bolt hit a tree 20 paces away from us It was frightening and it showered us with leaves and the pundits smell and of course we was done for a while But when we managed to get our wits about us we love to decide if my gosh what's gonna happen with that little cup She's probably gonna forever associate their definitely crash with us Well, we need not worry.

We love in the swamp in a tent But I must tell you every day is it's zillirating but also a heart for in our throat The huge amount of the time because we drive these through water and it's the unknown territory But we really they're Seeking and searching and forming the iconic cats Now one of the big things of course everybody knows that cats hate

 meters and in most parts it is saline not for green. So you can't install hand pumps for tube wells though there is no electricity in most of the villages but suppose you use the green technology solar pumps they are of no use in this area. So welcome to the Golden Desert. Clouds seldom visit this area but we find 40 different names of clouds. In this dialect use air. There are number of techniques to harvest rain. This is a new word it's a new program but for the desert society this is no program this is their life and they harvest rain in many ways. So this is the first device they use in harvesting rain. It's called Kuhn somewhere it is called Taka and you can notice they have created a kind of false sketchman the desert is there and use some small field and this is all big raised plate form. You can notice a small holes the water will fall on this sketchman and there is a slope. Sometimes our engineers and architects do not care about slopes in bathrooms but here they will care properly and the water will go where it should go and then it is 40 feet deep. The water proofing is done perfectly better than our city contractors because not a single drop should go waste in this. They collect 100,000 liters in one season and this is pure drinking water. Below the surface there is hard saline water but now you can have this for year around. It's a two houses we often use a term called bylaws because we are used to get written things but here it is unwritten bylaws and people make their house and the water storage tanks these raised plate form just like this stage. In fact they go 15 feet deep and collect rain water from roof this is small pipe and from their courtyard it can also harvest something like 25,000 in a good mansion. Another big one this is of course out of the hard coal desert area this is near Jaipur this is called Jaigal port and it can collect 6 million gallons of rain water.

 we resisted to the idea of applying evolutionary thinking to our thinking. And so I'm going to talk a little bit about that, keeping in mind that we have a lot on the program here. So you're out in the woods, you're out in the pasture, and you see this amp crawling up this blade of grass, climbs up to the top and it falls and it falls. So it climbs, trying to stay at the very top of the blade of grass. What is this amp doing? What is this innate of? What goals is this amp trying to achieve by applying this blade of grass? What's ellip for the amp? And the answer is, nothing. There's nothing in it for the amp. Well then, why is it doing this? Is it just a fluke? Yeah, it's just a fluke. It's a lancet fluke. It's a little brainworm, it's a parasitic brainworm that has to get into the stomach of a sheep or a cow in order to continue its life. So salmon, you know, swim upstream to get to their spawning grounds and lancet fluke's common deer are passing ant crawling into its brain and dried it up blade of grass like a altering deer. So there's nothing in it for the ant. The ant's brain has been hijacked by a parasite that infects people, inducing suicidal behavior. Pretty scary. Well, is anything like that happen with human beings? This is all under half of a cause other than one's own genetic fix. Of course. Well, it may already have occurred to you that a Islam means surrender of submission, of self-interest to the will of Allah. Well, this idea is not worse than hijack our brains. Now am I saying that it's sizable? Minority of the world's population has your brain hijacked by parasitic ideas. Oh, it's worse than that. Most people. There are a lot of ideas to die for. Freedom? Justice, truth, communism? Many people have laid down their lives for communism and many have laid down their lives for capitalism.

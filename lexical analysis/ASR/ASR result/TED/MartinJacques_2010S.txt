 Parabagh for when China will have a larger economy than the United States. Goldman Sachs projected in 2007. The post crisis projection is 2020. That's just a decade. China is going to change the world in two fundamental respects. First of all, it's a huge developing country. The population of 1.3 billion people, which has been growing for over 30 years at around 10% a year. And within a decade, it will have the largest economy in the world. Never before, in the modern era, has the largest economy in the world been that of a developing country rather than a developed country. Secondly, for the first time in the modern era, the dominant country in the world, which I think is what China will become. It will be not from the West and from very, very different civilisation in the news. Now I know it's a widespread assumption in the West. That as countries modernise, they also questionise. This is an illusion. It's an assumption that modernity is a product simply of competition, markets and technology. It is not. It is also shaped equally by history and culture. China is not like the West and it will not become like the West. It will remain in very fundamental respects very different. Now the big question here is obviously, how do we make sense of China? How do we try to understand what China is? One we have, Western moment, by and large, is the conventional approach is that we understand it really in Western terms, using Western ideas. We can't. Now I want to offer you three building blocks for trying to understand what China is like, just as a beginning. The first is this. That China is not really a nation state. It's called itself a nation state for the last hundred years. Everyone knows anything about China. It's a lot older than this. This was what China looked with the victory of the China dynasty, 221 BC at the end of the war in the state period. The birth of modern China. And you can see it against the boundaries of modern China. Or immediately afterwards the hand in the seat still 2000 years ago. And you can see already it occupies most of what we now know as Eastern China, which is where the vast majority of Chinese lived. Now, what is extraordinary about this is what gives China its sense of being China. What gives the Chinese the sense of what it is to be Chinese?

 there in that huge aisle of different types of toilet papers, you don't take out your cell phone and open a browser and go to a website to try to decide which of these different toilet papers is the most ecologically responsible purchase to make. So we don't really have easy access to all this relevant information that can just help us make optimal decisions about what to do next and what actions to take. And so my research group at the Media Lab has been developing a series of inventions to give us access to this information in a sort of easy way without requiring that the user changes any of their behavior and I'm here to unveil our latest effort and most successful efforts so far which is still very much a work in process. I'm actually wearing the device right now and you sort of cobbled it together with components that are off the shelf and that by the way only cost $350 at this point in time. I'm wearing a camera, just a simple webcam, a portable battery powered projection system with a little mirror. These components communicate to myself on in my pocket which acts as the communication and computation device and in the video here we see my student Panath mystery who's really the genius who's been implementing and designing this whole system and we see how this system lets him walk up to any surface and start using his hands to interact with the information that is projected in front of him. The system tracks the four significant fingers in this case is wearing simple marker caps and you may recognize but if you want a more stylish version you could also paint your nails in different colors and the camera basically tracks these four fingers and recognizes any gestures that he's making so he can just go to for example a map of Long Beach, zoom in and out etc. The system also recognizes iconic gestures such as need take a picture gesture and then takes a picture of whatever is in front of you and when he then walks back to the media lab he can just go up to any wall and project all the pictures that he's taken, sort through them and organized them and resize them etc. again using all natural gestures so some of you most likely were here two years ago and saw the demo by the Jeff Han or some of you may think well doesn't this look like the Microsoft Surface table and yes you also interact using natural gestures both hands and hands.

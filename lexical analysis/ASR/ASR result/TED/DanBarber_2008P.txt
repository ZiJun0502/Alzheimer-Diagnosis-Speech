 I'm not saying that there's not a rationale for being opposed to Fogra. The reasons usually just whittle down to the Gavash, which is the force feeding. Basically you take a goose or a duck and you eat force feed, a ton of grain down a throat. More grain in a couple of weeks than it would ever get in a lifetime. Slipper expands by eight times. The advice to say it's not the prettiest picture of sustainable farming. The problem for chefs is that it's so freaking delicious. I mean, I love the stuff. It is fatty, it's sweet, silky, it's anxious. It makes everything else you put it with taste incredible. Can we produce a menu that's delicious without Fogra? Yes, sure. You can also bike the tour de France without steroids. Not a lot of people are doing it and for good reason. A couple of months ago, a friend of mine sent me a link to this guy at Duarteau Sousa. Duarteau is doing what he calls natural Fogra. What's natural about Fogra? To take advantage of when the temperature drops in the fall, geese and ducks, gorge on food to prepare for the harsh realities of winter. The rest of the year, they're free to roam around at Duarteau's land and eat what they want. No gavage, no horse feeding, no factory-like conditions, no cruelty. It's shockingly not a new idea. His great-granddad started Patria de Sousa in 1812. They've been doing it quietly ever since. That is. Until last year. In Eduardo won the coup de c≈ìur, the coveted French gastronomic prize. It's like the Olympics of food products. He placed first for his Fogra. Big, big problem. As he said to me, that really pissed the French off. Said it sort of gleefully. It was all over the papers I read about. The Spanish chef accused him of cheating. The implicated Spanish government. Amazingly. Amazing. Here's a scale.

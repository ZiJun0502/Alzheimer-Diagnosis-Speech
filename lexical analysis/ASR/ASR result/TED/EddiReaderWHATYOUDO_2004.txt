 It's not just what you're for when, it's what you choose to bear. It's not how big your share is, it's how much you can share. It's not how fights you dreamt of, it's those you're in for. It's not what you've been given, it's what you do with what you've gone on. I want to use the two strong legs, if you only run away. I want to use the planar's voice, if you've nothing good to see you. I want to use the strength of my song, if you only push and shove. I want to use the two good ears, if you cannot hear those you love. I want to use the two strong legs, if you only push and shove. I want to use the two strong legs. I'm going to play the piano. I'm going to play the piano. I'm going to play the piano. I'm going to play the piano. I'm going to play the piano. I'm going to play the piano. I'm going to play the piano. I'm going to play the piano. I'm going to play the piano. I'm going to play the piano. I'm going to play the piano. I'm going to play the piano. I'm going to play the piano. I'm going to play the piano. Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes? Yes! Yes! Yes! What's the use of two good years? If you can't hear those in love, Between those who use their neighbors, And those who use the cane, Between those in constant power, And those in constant pain, Between those who run to glory, And those who cannot run, Tell me which ones are the groups, And which ones are the groups,

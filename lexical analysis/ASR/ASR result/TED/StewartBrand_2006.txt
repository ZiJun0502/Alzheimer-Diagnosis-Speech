 and Ranoza and Germany. Some people go to places like Shanghai and most go to the squatter cities, where aesthetics rule. And these are not really people pressed by poverty. They're people getting out of poverty as fast as they can. They're the dominant builders and no longer stand for dominant designers. They have home-brew infrastructure and vibrant urban life. One sixth of the GDP in India is coming out of Mumbai. The opt-house is not upgrading in a few cases the government helps. Education is the main event that can happen in cities. What's going on in the street in Mumbai? Al Gore knows. It's basically everything. There's no unemployment in the squatter cities. Everyone works. One sixth of humanity is there. It's soon gonna be more than that. So here's the first punchline. Cities are defused the population bomb. And here's the second punchline. That's the news from downtown. Here it is in perspective. Oh, it's just another day. It's just another day. It's just another day. It's just starting to shine down on our flight for billions of years. Now we're shining right back up. It's just another day. It's all running down. Thank you.

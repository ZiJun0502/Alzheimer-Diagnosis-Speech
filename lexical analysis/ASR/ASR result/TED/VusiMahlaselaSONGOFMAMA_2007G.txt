 to the government and police and subdued bullets. So every year June 16th, we'll call on all those comrades or students with that. And I was very young then, I was 11 years and I studied ask questions. And that's when my political education started. And I joined the Italian Youth Organization under the African National Congress. So as part of organizing this and what they were just a corporation, the police were round us up. As you know, they call us leaders. And I used to run away from home when I know that maybe the police might be coming around 9 or 10 June or so. And my grandmother, I go on time and said, no, look, you're not going to run away. This is your place. You stay here. And indeed, the police came because they all just arrest us and put us in jail and release us whenever they feel like. After the 20th or so. So it was on the 10th of June when they came and they surrounded the house. And my grandmother switched off call the lights in the house and opened the kitchen door. And she said to them, who is here? You're not going to take him tonight. I'm tired of you having to come here, harassing us while you're children are sleeping peaceful in your homes. He is here. And you're not going to take him. I've got a ball full of boiling water. The first one who comes in here gets it. And they left. And they left. And they left. And they left. And they left. And they left. And they left. And they left. And they left. And they left. And they left. And they left. And they left. And they left. And they left. And they left. And they left. And they left. And they left. And they left. And they left. And they left. And they left. And they left. And they left. And they left. And they left. And they left. And they left. And they left. And they left. And they left. That's it. And they left. And 50, down. And they left. And they left. And they left. And they left. And they left. And they left. And they left. And they left. All of them. And they left. Andshore. And now they left. And they left. And they left. And they left. And they left. And they left. And they left. And they left. And they left. And they left. Is it right?

 as landscapes and here blood density levels as music. This is some of the research that you're going to see that we're undertaking at the Allosphere. But first a little bit about this group of artist scientists and engineers that are working together. I'm a composer or just really trained in the inventor of the Allosphere. With my visual artist colleagues, we map complex mathematical algorithms that unfold in time and space visually and sonically. Our scientists colleagues are finding new patterns in the information and our engineering colleagues are making one of the largest dynamically varying computers in the world for this kind of data exploration. I'm going to fly you into five research projects in the Allosphere that are going to take you from biological macroscopic data all the way down to electron spin. This first project is called the Allabrain and it's our attempt to quantify beauty by finding which regions of the brain are interactive while witnessing something beautiful. If you're flying through the cortex of my colleagues brain, our narrative here is real FMRI data that's mapped visually and sonically. The brain novel world that we can fly through and interact with. You see 12 intelligent computer agents, the little rectangles that are flying in the brain with you, their mining blood density levels and they're reporting them back to you sonically. Higher density levels mean more activity in that point of the brain. They're actually singing these densities to you with higher pitches mapped to higher densities. We're now going to move from real biological data to bio-generative algorithms that create artificial nature in our next artistic and scientific installation. In this artistic and scientific installation bio-generative algorithms are helping us to understand self-generation and growth very important for simulation in the nanoscaled scientists. For artists, we're making new worlds that we can uncover and explore. These generative algorithms grow over time and they interact and communicate as a swarm of insects. Our researchers are interacting with this data by injecting bacterial code which are computer programs that allow these creatures to grow over time. We're going to move now from the biological and macroscopic world down into the atomic world as we fly into a lattice of atoms. This is real AFM atomic force microscope data from my colleagues in the Solid State Lighting and Energy Center. They've discovered a new bond, a new material for transparent solar cells. We're flying through 2000 lattice of atoms, oxygen, hydrogen and zinc. You view the bond in the triangle. It's four blue zinc atoms bonding with one white hydrogen atom. You see the electron flow with the streamlines. We as artists have generated for the scientists. This is allowing them to find the bonding nodes in any lattice of atoms. We think that makes a beautiful structural art. The sound that you're hearing, the actual emission

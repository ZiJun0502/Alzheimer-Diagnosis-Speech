 the leg doesn't direct contact with the ground and standing or walking. That's the traditional definition. But if you really want to do research, what do you have to do? You have to go to the literature and look about, look up what's known about feet. So go to the literature. You may be familiar with this literature. The problem is there are many, many feet. How do you do this? You need to survey off feet and extract principles of how they work. And I want you to help me do that in this next clip. As you see this clip, look for principles and also think about experiments that you might design in order to understand how a foot works. A research on the biomechanics of animal motion has allowed us to make a blueprint for a foot. It's a design inspired by nature, but it's not a copy of any specific foot you just looked at, but it's a synthesis of the secrets of many, many feet. It turns out that animals can go anywhere. They can local on substrates that vary as you saw in the probability of contact.

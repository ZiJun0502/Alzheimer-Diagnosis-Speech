 own people and answer the prayers of the faithful. And in the worship of my church, the most frequently used adjective about God is Almighty. But I have a problem with that. I have become more and more uncomfortable with this perception of God over the years. Do we really believe that God is the kind of male boss that we've been presenting in our worship and in our litigies over all these years? Of course, there have been thinkers who've suggested different ways of looking at God, exploring the feminine, nurturing side of divinity, suggesting that God expresses Himself or herself through powerlessness rather than power. Acknowledging that God is unknown and unnerbable by definition. Finding deep resonances with other religions and philosophies and ways of looking at life as part of what is a universal and global search for meaning. These ideas are well known in liberal academic circles. But clergy like myself have been reluctant to air them for fear of creating tension and division in our church communities for fear of upsetting the simple faith of more traditional believers. I've chosen not to rock the boat. Then on December 26 last year, just two months ago, that underwater earthquake triggered the tsunami. And two weeks later, Sunday morning lines January, I found myself standing in front of my congregation, intelligent, well-meaning, mostly thoughtful Christian people. And I needed to express on their behalf our feelings and our questions. I had my own personal responses, but I also have a public role and something needed to be said. And this is what I said. Shortly after the tsunami, I read a newspaper article written by the Archbishop of Canterbury, fine title, about the tragedy in southern Asia. The essence of what he said was this. The people most affected by the devastation and loss of life do not want intellectuals.

 Consciousness evolved into a shared sense of conscience. Change became not only possible, but inevitably. It puts a human face on issues which from afar can appear abstract or ideological or monumental in their global impact. What happens at ground level, far from the halls of power, happens to ordinary citizens one by one. And I understood the documentary photography has the ability to interpret events from their point of view. It gives a voice to those who otherwise would not have a voice. My Ted Wish. There's a vital story that needs to be told, and I wish for Ted to help me gain access to it, and then to help me come up with innovative and exciting ways to use news photography in the digital environment. Thank you very much.

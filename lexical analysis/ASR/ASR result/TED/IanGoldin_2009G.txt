 Straught in retimes life expectancy has gone up by about 25 years took from the stone age to achieve that Income has gone up from the majority of the world's population despite population going up by about two billion people over this period and Electricity has gone down from a half to about a quarter people on earth a huge opportunity Unleashing of new potential for innovation for development, but there's an underbelly There's two Achilles heels of globalization There's the Achilles heel of growing inequality those that are left out those that feel angry those that are not participating globalization has not been inclusive the second Achilles heel is complexity a growing Fragility a growing Britleness what happens in one place very quickly affects everything else This is systemic risk systemic shock you've seen it to the financial crisis You've seen from the pandemic flu. It will become virulent and it's something we have to build the Zidane second A lot of this is driven by what's happening on technology There's been huge leaps there will be a million fold improvement in what you can get for the same price in Computing by 2030. That's what the experience of the last 20 years has been it will continue Our computers our systems will be as Primitive as the Apollo's are for today our mobile phones are more powerful in the toddler Apollo space engine Our mobile phones are more powerful. That's the strongest computers of printing So what will this do it will create huge opportunities in technology Miniaturization as well. It will be invisible capacity invisible capacity in our bodies in our brains and in the air This is a dust mite on a nano-reprocating This sort of ability to do everything in new ways and least potential not least in the area of medicine This is a stem cell that we've developed here in Oxford from a embryonic stem cell You can develop any part of the body Increasing the over time this will be possible from our own skin able to replicate parts of the body Fantastic potential regenerative medicine. I don't think there'll be a special Olympics long after canteen 30 Because of this capacity to regenerate parts of the body But the question is who will have it the other major development is going to be in the area of what can happen on genetics The capacity to create as this mouse has been genetically modified something which goes three times faster Last for three times longer and we can produce as this mouse can't to the age of our equivalent of 80 years With using about the same amount of food But will this only be available for the super rich for those that can afford it? Are we heading for a new eugenics will only those that are able to afford it able to be the super race of the future So the big question for us is how do we manage this technology for change? How do we ensure that it creates a more inclusive technology a technology which means that not only as we grow older But we can also grow wiser and we're able support populations in the future one of the most dramatic manifestations of these improvements will be

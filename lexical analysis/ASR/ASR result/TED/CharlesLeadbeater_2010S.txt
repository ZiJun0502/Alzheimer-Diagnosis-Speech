 in a way all those fantastic pictures is this one that Fantish point determines everything you see what Brian was saying was science has opened up successfully different vantage points from which we can see ourselves that's why it's so valuable so the vantage point you take determines virtually everything that you see the question that you ask is determined much of the answer you get and so if you ask this question where would you look to see the future of education the answer that we've traditionally given to that is very straightforward at least in the last 20 years you go to Finland Finland is the best place in the world to see school systems the things maybe a bit boring impressive and very high suicide rate but by golly they are qualifying and they have absolutely amazing education system and so we all troop off to Finland and we wander at their social democratic miracle in Finland and its cultural generative and then we struggle to imagine how we might bring lessons back well so for the last year with the help of Cisco who's possibly for some of army easy to do this I've been looking somewhere else because actually radical innovation does sometimes calm you very best but it often comes from places where you have huge need unmet latent and not enough resources for traditional solutions to work traditional high cost solutions which depend on professionals which is what schools and hospitals are so I ended up in places like this this is a place with monkey hill it's one of the hundreds of favelas in Rio most of the population growth of the next 50 years will be in cities we will grow by six cities of 12 million people a year for the next 30 years almost all of that growth will be in the developed world almost all of that growth will be in places like monkey hill this is where you'll find the fastest growing young populations as well so if you want recipes to work for virtually anything health education government politics and education you have to go to these places if you go to these places you meet people like this this is a guy called Wonderson at the age of 14 in common with many 14 year olds in the Brazilian education system who dropped out of school he was born and Wonderson instead went into what provided kind of opportunity and hope in place that he lived which was the drugs train and by the age of 16 with rapid promotion he was running drugs trading 10 vellas he was turning over $200,000 weekly to 200 people he was going to be dead by the age of 25 and luckily he met this guy who is Rodrigo Badgey and the owner of the first laptop to let me appear in Brazil 1994 Rodrigo started something called CBI which took computers, donations by corporations put them into community centers in the vellas and created places

 factoring there's the inside of our lab we haven't shown this before but our people had to do some 5,000 different mixes to get this right to hit our targets and they worked absolutely very very very hard. So then we went for it and built our production line in China we don't build this production equipment any longer in the US unfortunately we did the line install over the summer we started right there with absolutely nothing you're seeing for the first time a brand new drywall production line not made using gypsum at all that's the finished production line there we got our first panel out on December 3rd that is the slurry being poured onto paper basically that's the line running the exciting thing is look at the faces of the people these are people who work this project for two to three years and they are so excited that's the first board off the line our vice president of operation kissing the board obviously very very excited but this is a huge huge impact on the environment who signed the first panel just a few weeks after that had a great signing ceremony leading to people hopefully using these products across the world and we've got cradle to cradle gold on this thing we happen to win just recently the green product of the year for the reinvention of drywall from popular science thank you thank you so here's what we learned 8,000 gallons of gas equivalent to build one house probably had no idea it's like driving around the world six times we must change everything look around the room chairs wood everything around us has to change and we're not going to lick this problem don't listen to people who say you can't do this because anyone can and these job losses we can fix them with green collar jobs we've got four plants we're building this stuff around the country going as fast as we can 2.5 million cars worth of gypsum you know CO2 generated right so what will you do I'll tell you what I did and why I did it and I know my time's up those are my kids Natalie and David when they have their kids 2050 they better look back at grandpa and say hey you gave it a good shot you did the best you could with a team that you had so my hope is that when you leave Ted you will look at reducing your carbon footprint in however you can do it and if you don't know how please find me I will help you last but not least Bill Gates I know you invented windows what do you see maybe next year we're kind of windows we've invented thank you so much

 government and Sylvia Earle and I were on expedition in this submarine 20 years ago in Japan and on my dive I went down 18,000 feet to an area that I thought would be Christine wilderness area on the Seafloor but when I got there I found lots of plastic garbage and other debris and it was really a turning point in my life where I started to realize that I couldn't just go have fun doing science exploration I needed to put it into a context I needed the head towards conservation goals so I began to work with National Geographic Society and others and land expeditions Antarctica I led three diving expeditions to Antarctica 10 years ago was a seminal trip where we explored that big iceberg B15 the largest iceberg in history that broke off the Ross ice shell and we developed techniques to dive inside and under the iceberg such as heating pads on our kidneys with a battery that we dragged around so that as the blood flowed through our kidneys we get a little boost of warmth before going back into our bodies but after three trips to Antarctica decided that it might be nicer to work in warmer water and that same year 10 years ago I headed north to Phoenix Islands and I'm gonna tell you that story here in the moment but before I do I just want you to ponder this graph for a moment you may have seen this in other forms but the top line is the amount of protected area on land globally and it's about 12% and you can see that it kind of hockey sticks up around the 1960s and 70s and it's kind of a nice trajectory right now and that's probably because that's why everybody got aware of the environment and first day and all the stuff that happened in the 60s with the hippies and everything really did I think have an effect on global awareness but the ocean protected area is basically flat line until right about now it appears to be ticking up I do believe that we are at the hockey stick point of the protected area in the ocean I think we would have gotten there a lot earlier if we could see what happens in the ocean like we can see what happens on land but unfortunately the ocean is opaque and we can't see what's going on and therefore we're way behind on protection scuba diving submersible for all the work that we're setting about to do here we'll help rectify that so where are the Phoenix Islands they were the world's largest green protected area up until last week and the Chagos Archipelago is declared it's in the mid-Pacific it's about five days from anywhere if you want to get to the Phoenix Islands it's five days from Fiji it's five days from Hawaii it's five days from Samoa it's out in the middle of the Pacific right around the equator I had never heard of the islands ten years ago nor the country Kiribati that owns them tell two friends of mine who run a little board dive boat in Fiji said Greg would you need a scientific expedition up to these islands they've never been died and I said yeah but you know tell me where they are in the country that owns them so that's what I've

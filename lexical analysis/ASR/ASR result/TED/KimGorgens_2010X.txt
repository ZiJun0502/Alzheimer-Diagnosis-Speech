 July. Zup for safety. Water wings, an inch of water, and then finally all suited up for the 90-minute drive to Kaapu Mountain. So you could get kind of a feel for this. So my baby Vander is eight years old now and despite being cursed with my athletic inability, he plays soccer. He's interested in playing football, wants to learn how to ride a unicycle. So why would I worry? Because this is what I do. This is what I teach. It's what I study. It's what I treat. And I know that kids get concussed every year. In fact, more than four million people sustain a concussion every year. And these data are just among kids under 14 who are seen in emergency rooms. And so when kids sustain a concussion, we talk about them getting dinged or getting their bell wrong. But what is it that we're really talking about? Let's take a look. All right. Starsky and Hutch. Arguably, yes. So a car accident, 40 miles an hour into a fixed barrier. 35 Gs. A heavyweight boxer punches his straight in the face. 58 Gs. In case you missed it, we'll look again. So look to the right hand side of the screen. What would you say? How many Gs? Close? 72? Would it be crazy to know 103 Gs? The average concussive impact is 95 Gs. Now, when the kid on the right doesn't get up, right, we know they've had a concussion. But how about the kid on the left? Or the athlete that leaves the field to play? How do we know if he or she has sustained concussion? How do we know that legislation that would require they be pulled from play, cleared for return to play, applies to them? The definition of concussion doesn't actually require a loss of consciousness. It requires only a change in consciousness. And that can be any one or a number of symptoms, including feeling foggy, feeling dizzy, hearing a ringing in your ear, being more impulsive or hostile than usual. So given all of that, and given how darn neurotic I am, how do I get any sleep at all? Because I know our brains are resilient.

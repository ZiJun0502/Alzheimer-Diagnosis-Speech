 So that's the kind of flavor of the kind of people we have there. We try to avoid blowing ourselves now This one I thought I'll show you guess which one is a JPL employee You know out of this ground I tried to come like him this morning, but as I walked out then it was too cold And I said I'd better put my shirt back on but more importantly the reason I wanted to show this picture look Where the other people are looking and look what where he is looking Whatever anybody else look look somewhere else and go do something different You know I'm doing that and that's kind of what has been the spirit of what we are doing and I want to tell you a quote from Ralph Emerson that one of my colleagues you know put on my wall in my office and it says Do not go where the path may lead go instead where there is no path and leave it trail And that's my recommendation to all of you look where everybody is doing what they are doing Go do something completely different. Don't try to improve a little bit on what somebody else is doing But that doesn't get you very far In our early days we used to work a lot on the rockets But we also used to have a lot of parties You know as you can see that the one of our parties you know a few years ago But then a big difference happened about 50 years ago after Sputnik was launched we launched the first American satellite and that's the one you see on the left in there and here we made a 180 degrees change we changed from a rocket house to be an exploration house and that was done over a Period of couple of years and now we are the leading organization You know exploring space on on all of your behalf But even when we did that we had to remind ourselves at some time there are setbacks So you see on the bottom that rocket was supposed to go upward somehow it ended up going sideways So that's what we call the misguided the missile But then also just to celebrate that we started an event at JPL for miss guided missile So we used to have a celebration every year and select There used to be competition and Paris and so on It's not very appropriate to do it now some people tell me to do it and well That's not really proper, you know these days So we do something a little bit more serious and that's where you see in the last Rose Bowl, you know when we entered one of the floats that's more on the play side and on the right side That's a rover just before we finished its testing To take it to the Cape Pumauchin these are the rovers that you have on Mars now So that kind of tell you about kind of the fun things, you know and the serious things that we try to do But I saw that I'm going to show you a short clip of one of our employees to kind of give you an idea about some some of the talent But you have to do it Where it's safety is an instrument a lot better it branches on more than the experimental side There's the improvisational side of jazz. There's a heavy hitting sound a rock Being able to treat the sound as an instrument and be able to dig for more abstract sounds Things to play live next to what time

 So I have many of these books and I've been keeping them for about the last eight or nine years They accompany me wherever I go in my life and I fill them with all sorts of things Records of my lived experience. So watercolor paintings drawings of what I see Dead flowers dead insects pasted ticket stubs rusting coins business cards writings And in these books you can find these short little glimpses of moments and experiences and people that I meet and And you know after keeping these books for a number of years I started to become very interested in collecting not only my own personal artifacts But also the artifacts of other people so I started collecting found objects This is a photograph I found lying in a gutter in New York City about 10 years ago on the front You can see the tattered black and white photo of a woman's face and on the back It says to Judy the girl with the bill Bailey voice have fun in whatever you do And I really loved this idea of the partial glimpse into somebody's life as opposed to knowing the whole story Just knowing a little bit of the story and then letting your own mind fill in the rest and that idea of a partial glimpse is something that will come back in a lot of the work I'll be showing later today So around this time I was studying computer science at Princeton University and I noticed that it was suddenly possible to collect These sorts of personal artifacts not just from street corners, but also from the internet and that suddenly people on mass were leaving Scores and scores of digital footprints online that told stories of their private lives Blog posts photographs thoughts feelings opinions all of these things were being expressed by people online and leaving behind trails So I started to write computer programs that study very very large sets of these online footprints One such project is about a year and a half old. It's called we feel fine This is a project that scans the world's newly posted blog entries every two or three minutes searching for occurrences of the phrases I feel and I am feeling when it finds one of those phrases it grabs the whole sentence up to the period and Also tries to identify demographic information about the author so their gender their age their geographic location and what the weather conditions were like when they wrote that sentence It collects about 20,000 such sentences a day and it's been running for about a year and a half having collected over 10 and a half million feelings now This is then how they're presented these dots here represent some of the English speaking world's feelings from the last few hours Each each dot being a single sentence stated by a single blogger and the color of each dot corresponds to the type of feeling inside So the bright ones are happy and the dark ones are sad and the diameter of each dot corresponds to the length of the sentence inside So the small ones are short and the bigger ones are longer. I Feel fine with the body I'm in there'll be no easy excuse for why I still feel uncomfortable Uncomfortable being close to my boyfriend from a 22 year old in Japan I got this on some trading locally, but really don't feel like screwing with wiring and crap Also some of the feelings contain photographs in the blog posts and when that happens These montage compositions are automatically created which consists of the sentence and image is being combined and Any of these can be opened up to reveal the sentence inside

 Okay, this is the title of my talk today. I just want to give you a quick overview. First of all, please remember I'm completely politically correct and I mean everything with great affection. If any of you have sensitive stomachs or feeling queasy, now's the time to check your blackberry. Just to review, this is my TED Talk. We're going to do some jokes, some gags, some little skits, and then we're going to talk about the L1 point. So the one of the questions I asked myself was was this the most distressing TED ever? Let's try and sum things up, shall we? Images of Limeron regeneration and faces filled with smallpox, 21% of the conference. Mentions of polar bears drowning, 4%, images of the earth being wiped out by flood or bird flu, 64% and David Pogue singing show tunes. Because this is the most distressing TED ever, I've been working with Neil Gershinfeld on next year's TED bag. If the conference is anywhere near this distressing, then we're going to have a screen bag next year. It's going to be a cradle to cradle screen bag of course. So you're going to be able to go like this. I'm going to go over here. And open up. You all back to TED University. This wonderful woman is teaching how to chop sun chips. So Robert Wright, I don't know, I felt like if there's anyone that Helen needed to give antidepressants to it might have been him. I want to deliberately interfere with his dopamine levels. He was talking about morality. Economy class morality is we want to bomb you back to the Stone Age. Business class morality is don't bomb Japan, they build my car. Business class morality is don't bomb Mexico, they clean my house. Yes, it is politically incorrect. Alright, now I want to do a thing for you. Alright, now we go like white shit too long. You're on the right side. You're on the right side.

 run their own schools. They target poor families and convince the parents to send their children. In return, they provide free food and shelter and sometimes pay the families a monthly stipend. We've obtained a propaganda video made by the Taliban. Young boys are taught justifications for suicide attacks and the execution of spies. I make contact with a child from SWAT who studied in a Madrasa like this. Hazrat Ali is from a poor farming family in SWAT. He joined the Taliban a year ago when he was 13. He tells me the children are then given months of military training. The Taliban have protected the way in which they recruit and train children. I think it's a five step process. Step one is that the Taliban pray on families that are large, that are poor, that live in rural areas. They separate the parents from the children by promising to provide food, clothing, shelter to these children. Then they ship them off hundreds of miles away to hard-line schools that run along the Taliban agenda. Step two, they teach the children the Quran which is Islam's holiest book in Arabic. A language these children do not understand and cannot speak. They rely very heavily on teachers who I have personally seen distort the message to these children as and when it suits their purpose too. These children are explicitly forbidden from reading newspapers, listening to radio, reading any books that the teachers do not prescribe them. If any child is found violating these rules, he is severely reprimanded. Effectively the Taliban create a complete blackout of any other source of information for these children. Step three, the Taliban want these children to hate the world that they currently live in. So, they beat these children, I have seen it. They feed them twice a day, dry bread and water. They rarely allow them.

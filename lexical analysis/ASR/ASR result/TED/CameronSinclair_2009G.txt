 and their passports taken away. While it's easy to point the finger at local officials and higher authorities, 99% of these people are hired by the private sector, and so therefore we're equally if not more accountable. Groups like Buildsafe UAE have emerged for the numbers simply overwhelming. In August 2008, UAE public officials noted that 40% of the country's 1,098 labor camps had violated minimum health and fire safety regulations and lost summer more than 10,000 workers protested for the non-payment of wages, for the poor quality of food, and inadequate housing, and then the financial collapse happened. When the contractors have gone bust as they've been overleveraged like everyone else, the difference is everything goes missing. Documentation, passports, and tickets home for these workers. Currently right now, thousands of workers are abandoned, there's no way back home, and there's no way, no proof of arrival. These are the Booman Busk refugees. The question is, as a building professional, as an architect, an engineer, as a developer, if you know this is going on, as we go to the sites every single week, are you complacent or complicit in the human rights violations? So let's forget your environmental footprint. Let's think about your ethical footprints. What good is it to build a zero carbon energy efficient complex when the labor producing this architectural gem is unethical at best? Now recently I've been told I've been taking the high road, but quite frankly on this issue, there is no other road. So let's not forget who's really paying the price of his financial collapse. And as we worry about our next job in the office, let's not forget the next design that we can get to keep our workers. Let's not forget these men who are truly dying for work.

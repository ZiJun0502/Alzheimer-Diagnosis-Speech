 I asked how many molecules that were in there, and nobody would tell me, so I put it through a GC gas chromatograph that I have in my in my office, and it's about 400 So what you're smelling is several hundred molecules Floating through the air hitting your nose and Do not get the impression that this is very subjective. You are all smelling pretty much the same thing Okay, smell has this reputation of being somewhat you know different for each person. It's not really true and the perfume ratio is you they can't be true because if it were like that It wouldn't be an art. Okay now Wilder it smells off so we let me tell you the history of an idea Everything that you're smelling in here comes from Is made up of atoms that comes from what I call the upper east side of the periodic table a nice safe neighborhood You you really don't want to leave it if you want to have a career in perfumance and people have tried it in 1920 to add things from the Bad parts and it didn't really work. These are the five atoms from which just about everything you're going to smell in real life from coffee to fragrance and made of the Top note that you smell at the very beginning this sort of cut grass green what we call in perfumer There are weird terms and this would be called a green note because it smells of something green like cut grass this is cis-3 hexenol and Just I had to learn Chemistry on the fly in the last three years very expensive high school chemistry education This has a six carbon atoms. So hex Hexenol it has one double bond it has an alcohol on the end So it's all and that's why they call it cis-3 hexenol once you figure this out you can really impress people with parties This smells of cut grass now. This is the skeleton of the molecule If you dress it up with atoms hydrogen atoms that's what it looks like when you have it on your computer But actually it's sort of more like this since the atoms have a certain sphere that you cannot penetrate the repell okay now Why does this thing smell of Cut grass, okay? What is it smell of Potatoes or Violets well, they're really two theories the first theory is it must be the shape And that's a perfectly reasonable theory in a sense that almost everything else in biology works by shape And signs that you things up Antibodies it's all of you know, there's fit between the protein and whatever it is grabbing in this case of smell And and I will try and explain to you what's wrong with this notion and the other theory is that we smell molecular vibrations Now this is a totally insane idea when I first came across it in the early 90s I thought my predecessor Malcolm Dyson and Bob Wright had really taken leave of their senses and I'll explain to you why this Wasn't case however I gradually came to realize they may be right and I'm still I have to convince all my colleagues And this is so but I'm working on it

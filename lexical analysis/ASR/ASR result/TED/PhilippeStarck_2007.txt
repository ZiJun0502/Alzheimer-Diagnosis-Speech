 You are right, but they are piranhas, they push you, you must sing, I don't know either. So, we, because I have nothing to show, nothing to say, we shall try to speak about some signals. We can start if you want by understanding that just you start, it's not interesting, but how I work. When somebody comes to me and asks for what I am known, means yes, the most bizarre toilet brush to speak beautiful toilet seats. And why not a toothbrush? I don't try to design the toothbrush. I don't try to say that we'll be a beautiful object and sing like that. I don't interest me because there is a different type of design. The one we can call that the cynical design, that means the design, by Raymond Louis Winsor-Fifties, who said what is ugly is bad sale. The less normal, which is terrible, that means the design must be just the weapon for marketing, for producers to make product more sexy like that they sell more. After, I call that the cynical design. After, there is the narcissistic design, it's fantastic designer, we design only for other fantastic designers. After, there is people like me who try to deserve to exist and who are so ashamed to make this useless job, who try to do it in a other way, and they try to make the object for the result, for the profit, for the human being, the person who will use it. If I don't sing about the toys, I think what will be the effect of the toothbrush in the mouth? To understand what will be the effect of the toothbrush in the mouth, I must imagine who own this mouth? What is the life of the owner of this mouth? In what society this guy lives? What civilization creates this society? What animal species creates this civilization? When I arrive, I am not so intelligent, when I arrive at the level of animal species that become really interesting, me I have strictly no power to change anything. But when I come back, I can understand who I am.

 where I was asked some years ago to do a science museum on a site's right downtown by the river and I thought the secret of the site is to make the building of the river part of the river Unfortunately though the site was separated from the river by McLean's Boulevard So I suggested let's let's be root McLean's and that gave birth instantly to friends of McLean's Boulevard And it took six months to re-root it the first image I showed the building committee was this observatory as Tomarkov's or the Janta Munteron in Jaipur because I talked about what makes a building a building of science And it seemed to me that this structure complex rich and yet totally rational it's an instrument had something to do with science and somehow building for science should be different and unique and Speak of there and so my first sketch after I left was to say let's cut the channel and Make an island and make an island building. I got all excited and came back and The sort of look with me at this name said an island this used to be an island acumen island and we filled in the channel during the depression to create jobs and So the process began and they said you can't put it all in an island some of it has to be on the mainland because We don't want to turn on back to the community and Very merged a design the galleries sort of forming an island and you could walk through them or on the roof and There were all kinds of exciting features you could come in through the Landsite buildings walk through the galleries into playgrounds in the landscape if you were cheap You could walk on top of the bridge of the roof peaking the Exhibits and then get totally seduced come back and pay the five dollars admission And the client was happy was sort of happy because we were a four million dollars of budget But but the century happy but I was still troubled and I was troubled because I felt this was Capricious it was complex, but there was something capricious about It's complexity it was what I would say compositional complexity and I felt that if I had to fulfill what I talked about ability to science there had to be some kind of a generating idea some kind of a generating geometry And this gave birth to the idea of having to royal generating geometry With its center one with its center deep in the earth for the land side building and a tall right with its center In the sky for the island building a tall roared for those who don't know is the surface of a donut or for some of us a bagel and Out of this idea started

 subject and I work for the Discovery Channel and we want to portray accurately whatever it is we do and we certainly want to do it with a lot of respect for the animals so I call the humane society and I say look I'm going to be castrating some lamps can you tell me the deal and they're like yeah it's pretty straightforward they use a band basically a rubber band like this a little smaller this one was actually around the playing cards I got yesterday but it had a certain familiarity to it and I said well what exactly is the process and they said the band is applied to the tail tightly and then another band is applied to the scrotum tightly let flows slowly retarded a week later the parts and questions fall off great got it okay I call the SPCA to confirm this they confirm it I also call PETA just for fun and they don't like it but they confirm okay that's basically how you do it so the next day I go out and I'm given a horse and we go get the lamps and we take them to a pen that we built and we go about the business of animal husbandry Melanie is the wife of Albert Albert's the shepherd in question Melanie picks up a lamb two hands one hand on both legs and the right like rise on the left lamb goes on the post she opens it up great Albert goes in I follow Albert and cruise around I always watch the process done the first time before I try it being an apprentice you know you do that Albert reaches in his pocket to pull out you know this black rubber band but what comes out instead is a knife and I'm like that's not rubber at all you know and and he kind of flicked it open in a way that caught the sun that was just coming over the rock is it was very it was it was it was impressive in the space of about two seconds Albert had the knife between the cartilage of the tail right next to the butt of the lamb and very quickly the tail was gone and in the bucket that I was holding a second later with a big thumb and a well-callist forefinger he had to scrolled him firmly in his grasp and he pulled it toward him like so and he took the knife and he put it on the tip now you think you know what's coming you don't okay he slips it throws the tip over his shoulder and then grabs the scrolled him and pushes it upward and then his head dips down obscuring my view but what I hear is a slurping sound and a noise that sounds like velcro being yanked off a sticky wall and I'm not even kidding can we roll the video no I'm kidding we don't I thought it best to talk in pictures so I do something now I've never ever done on a dirty job shoot ever I say I'm out stop you guys know the show we use take one we don't do take to there is no writing there's no scripting there's no nonsense we don't floor around we don't rehearse we shoot what we get I said stop this is nuts I mean you know what I'm saying

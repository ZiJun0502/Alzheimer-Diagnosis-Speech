 20, 25,000 years ago. And what if we go back beyond that single ancestor when there was presumably a competition among many languages? How far back does that go? How far back does modern language go? How many tens, how many tens of thousands of years did it go back? Do you have a hunch or a hope for what the answer that is? Well, I would guess that modern language must be older than the cave paintings and cave engravings and cave sculptures and dance steps in the soft clay of the caves in Western Europe in the origination period. Some 35,000 years ago, or earlier. I can't believe they did all those things and didn't also have modern language. So I would guess that the actual origin goes back at least that far in the past. But that doesn't mean that all or many or most of today's language, a tested language, couldn't descend perhaps from one that's much younger than that, like say, 20,000 years or something of that. That's what we call a bottleneck. Well, Fidocan just may have been right. You may just know more about everything than anyone. So it's been an honor. Thank you, Mark. Go on. Thank you.

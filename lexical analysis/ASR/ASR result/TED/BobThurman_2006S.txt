 it is and the local Gaysha movie star sort of person raised the elders of the city of Echariot and invited him first so he was hanging out with the movie star and of course they were grumbling he's supposed to be religious and all this and what's he doing over there at Amrapali's house with all his 500 monks and so on they were all grumbling and so they would they boycott him they wouldn't go listen to him but the young people all came and they brought this kind of a jewel parasol and they put it on the ground and as soon as they've laid all these all their big stack of these jewel parasol that they used to carry mentioned in India he he performed their kind of special effect which made it into a giant planetarium the wonder of the universe everyone looked in that and they saw and they had the total interconnectedness of all life in all universes and of course in the Buddhist cosmos there are millions and billions of planets with human life on it and lightened beings can see the life on all the other planets so they don't when they look out and they see the those lights that you showed this guy they don't they don't just see sort of pieces of matter burning or rocks or flames or gases exploding they actually see landscapes in human beings and gods and dragons and serpent beings and goddesses and things like that so he he he's taught he made that special effect at the beginning to get everyone to think about interconnection interconnectedness and how everything in life was totally interconnected and then Lele Lele Mase I know his other name Lele Lele told us about interconnection and how we're all totally interconnected here and how we've all known each other and of course in the again in the Buddhist universe we've already done this already billions of times in many many lifetimes in the past and I didn't give the talk always and Chihuahua didn't then Lele did and then Edwin and Jim didn't you didn't and we had to watch you and so forth and we're all still trying to I guess we're all trying to become testers if that's if that's a modern form of enlightenment I guess so because in a way if tens to relate to all this interconnectedness of all the computers and everything it's the it's the forging of a mass awareness of where everybody really know everything that's going on everywhere in the planet and therefore it will it will become in what compassion is is where it will become intolerable for us totally intolerable that we sit here and comfort and in pleasure and enjoying the life of the mind or the Lele whatever it is and there are people who just absolutely are like real with this disease and they cannot have a bite of food and they have no place where they're being brutalized by some terrible person and so forth it just becomes intolerable and with all of us knowing everything then we're all we're kind of forced by technology to become Buddha something to become enlightened and of course we all be deeply disappointed or

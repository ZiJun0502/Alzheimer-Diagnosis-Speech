 Get taken for men we don't resemble in the least. Are you? No. It's a winter wonderland in the belly of the beast. And black min ski. Black min ski. Black min sin back sushi with a scorn, yakusa splare. We make postmodern art with bacon grease and hot comb hair. We secretly play big toven inside our basemobiles. We can tell you how cool looks but cannot show you how it feels. When black min ski. When black min ski. Black men now are students of gay sensibility. We wear ironed t-shirts drenched in cold unknown to thee. We get baptized in walt and pond amongst the serene moth because the cleansing blood of Jesus could not do a thorough job. Black min ski. Black min ski. Chinese guys can jump real high and Germans cook so food. White boys wrap and hippies nap their drets up to the root. Jazz is now suburban. It's more cellously clean. Now we've got by agra everyone's a sex machine. So black min ski. What else can we do? Black min ski. Black min ski. Black min ski. Some kids are described as friends say I am race obsessed. The luxury of your opinion shows that you are blessed. See I have poems about sunsets, flowers and the rain.

 a renauton I rescued, Dodoy. That changed my life quite dramatically and as of today I have almost 1000 renauton babies in my two centers, which is no no no wrong. It's horrible, it's a proof of our failing to save them in the wild. It's not good, this is merely proof of everyone failing to do the right thing, having more than all the renautons and all the zoos in the world together, just now like victims for every baby, six having disappeared from the forest. The forest station, especially for oil palm, to provide biofuel for the western countries is what's causing these problems and those are the Pete Swarm Forest on 20 meters of beat, the largest accumulation of organic material in the world. When you open this for growing oil palms, you're creating CO2 volcanoes that are emitting so much CO2 that my country is now the third largest emitter of greenhouse gases in the world after China and the United States and we don't have any industry at all. Only because of this deep forest station and these are horrible images, I'm not going to talk too long about it, but there are so many of the family of Uche, which are not so fortunate to live out there in the forest that still have to go through that process and I don't know anymore where to put them. So I decided I had to come up with a solution for her, but also a solution that will benefit the people that are trying to exploit those forests to get their hands on the last timber and that are causing in that way the loss of habitat and all those victims. So I created to place some watch of the starry and the idea was if I can do this on the worst possible place that I can think of, there's really nothing left. No one will have an excuse to say yeah, but no. Everyone should be able to follow this. So we're in Estonia, this is the place up there where I started. As you can see there's only yellow terrain, there's nothing left just a bit of grass in 2002. We had about 50% of the people job was there. There was a huge amount of crime. People spend so much of their money on health issues and on drinking water. There was no agricultural productivity left. This was porous district and the whole province and it was a total extinction of wildlife. This was like a biological desert when I stood there in the grass, it's hot, not even the sound of insects, just this waving grass. Still, four years later we have created jobs for about three thousand people. The climate has changed, I will show you, the climate issue is no more flooding, no more fires, it's no longer the porous district and there is a huge development of biodiversity. We got over a thousand three species. We have 137 bird species as of today. We have 30 species of reptiles. So what?

 the hunger and revolution was raging and they decided to escape hungry and they got in a boat and yet another divergence the boat was either going to Canada or to Australia they got on and didn't know where they were going and ended up in Canada so to make a long story short they came to Canada my grandmother beat with a chemist she worked at the Banting Institute in Toronto and at 44 she died of stomach cancer I never met my grandmother but I carry on her name her exact name Eva Verdes and I like to think I carry on her scientific passion too I found this passion not far from here actually when I was nine years long my family was on a road trip and we were in the Grand Canyon and I had never been a reader when I was young my dad had tried me with a hearty boy I tried Nancy Drew I tried all that and I just I didn't like reading books and my mother bought this book when we were at the Grand Canyon called the hot zone it was all about the outbreak of the evil of Iris and something about it just kind of drew me towards it there was this big sort of bumpy looking virus on the cover and I just wanted to read it and I picked up that book and as we drove from the edge of the Grand Canyon to Big Sur and to actually hear where we are today in Monterey I read that book and from when I was reading that book I knew that I wanted to have a life in medicine and I wanted to be like the explorers I'd read about in the book who went into the jungles of Africa went into the research lots and just tried to figure out what this deadly virus was so from that moment on I read every medical book I could get my hands on and I just loved it so much and I was I was a passive observer of the medical world it wasn't until I entered high school that I thought maybe maybe now you know being a big high school kid I can maybe become an active part of this big medical world and I was 14 and I email professors at the local university to see if maybe I could go work in their lab and hardly anyone responded but I mean why would they respond to a 14 year old anyway and I got it I got to go talk to one professor Dr. Jacobs who accepted me into the lab and at that time I was really interested in neuroscience and wanted to do a research project in neurology specifically looking at the effects of heavy metal on the developing nervous system so I I started that and worked in his lab for a year and found the results that I guess you'd expect to find when you feed fruit plies heavy metals that it really really impaired the nervous system the spinal cord had breaks the neurons were crossing in every which way and from then I wanted to look not an impairment but at prevention of impairment

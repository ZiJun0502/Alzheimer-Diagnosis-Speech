 Devilmate Carousel Hunter. Flick the cigarette away. Grab the girl waiting there, give her a kiss. And then mouth is airplane, maybe for the last time. Of course I always wondered what would happen if he'd kissed the airplane first. Look. But this was real romance to me. Everything about flying in those years, which was, you have to stop and think for a moment, was probably the most advanced technological thing going on at the time. So as a youngster, I tried to get close to this by drawing airplanes constantly drawing airplanes. It's the way I got a part of this romance. Of course in a way when I say romance, I mean in part the aesthetics of that whole situation. I think the word is the holistic experience revolving around a product. The product was that airplane, but it built a romance. Even the parts of the airplane had French names, it's a fusion life, it's the empenon, it's the nest set. From a romance language, so that it was something that just got into your spirit, it did mine. And I decided I had to get closer and just drawing fantasy airplanes. I wanted to build airplanes. So I built model airplanes. And I found that in doing the model airplanes, the appearance drawings were not enough. You couldn't transfer those to the model itself. If you wanted it to fly, you had to learn the discipline of flying. You had to learn about aeronautics. You had to learn what made an airplane stay in the air. And of course as a model in those years, you couldn't control it, so it had to be self-writing and stay up without crashing. So I had to give up the approach of drawing the fantasy shapes and convert it to technical drawings. Shape of the wing, shape of the fuselage, and so on. And build an airplane over these drawings that I knew had followed some of the principles of flying. And so doing, I could produce a model that would fly, stay in the air, and it had once it was in the air, some of this romance.

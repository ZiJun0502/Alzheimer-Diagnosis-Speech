 Look how small! How tiny it has gotten! And you know the reason why, of course this is because of technology. Yeah. Any computer designers in the room? Yeah, well you guys are making my life miserable. Because track paths used to be round. You know, a nice round shape that makes a good cartoon. But what do you want to do with the flat track path, those square things? There's nothing I can do as a cartoonist. Well, I know the world is flat now. That's true. And internet has reached every corners of the world. Pours the remote places. Every village in Africa now has a cyber cafe. Don't go asking for a fappuccino there. So we are bridging the digital divide. The third world is connected. We are connected. And what happens next? Well, you've got mail. Yeah. Well, the internet has empowered us. It has empowered you. It has empowered me. It has empowered some other guys as well. You know, these last two cartoons, I did them live during a conference in Hanoi. And they were not used to that in communist 2.0 Vietnam. So I was cartooning live on a wide stream. It was quite a sensation. And then this guy came to me. He was taking pictures of me out of my sketches. And I thought, this is great. A Vietnamese fan. And as he came the second day, I thought, well, that should be a cartoon lover. And on the third day, I finally understood the guy was actually on duty. So by now, there will be 100 pictures of me smiling with my sketches in the files of the Vietnamese police. Nobody's true. The internet has changed the world. It has rocked the music industry. It has changed the way we consume music. For those of you all in have to remember, we used to have to go to the store to steal it. And well, it has changed the way your future employer will look at your application. So be careful with that. Facebook account. You might not told you, be careful. And technology has set us free. This is free Wi-Fi. But yeah, it has liberated us from the office desk.

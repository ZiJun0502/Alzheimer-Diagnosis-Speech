 Thomas Edison invented the circuit breaker in 1879. This is 130-year-old technology. And this is a problem because over 80% of all home electrical fires start below the safety threshold of circuit greatness. Hmm. So we considered all of this. And we realized that electrical appliances must be able to communicate directly with the power receptacle itself. Any electrical device and appliance, an extension cord, whatever, must be able to tell the power outlet, hey, power outlet, I'm drawing too much current, shut me off now before I start a fire. And the power outlet needs to be smart enough to do it. So here's what we did. We put a 10-cent digital transponder, a data tag in the appliance plug. And we put an inexpensive wireless data reader inside the receptacle so they can communicate. Now every home electrical system becomes an intelligent network. The appliance's safe operating parameters are embedded into its plug. If too much current is flowing, the intelligent receptacle turns itself off and prevents another fire from starting. We call this technology EFCI electrical fault circuit in the rupture. Okay, two more points. Every year in the USA, roughly 2,500 children are admitted to emergency rooms for shock and burn injuries related to electrical receptacles. And this is crazy. An intelligent receptacle prevents injuries because the power is always off until an intelligent plug is detected. Simple. Now besides saving lives, perhaps the greatest benefit of intelligent power is in its energy savings. This invention will reduce global energy consumption by allowing remote control and automation of every outlet in every home and business. Now you can choose to reduce your home energy bill by automatically cycling heavy loads like air conditioners and heaters, hotels and businesses and shut down unused rooms from a central location or even a cell phone. There are 10 billion electrical outlets in North America alone. The potential energy savings is very, very significant. So far we've applied for 414 patent claims of those 186 have been granted, 228 are in process and I'm pleased to announce that just three weeks ago we received our first international recognition, the 2009 CES Innovation Award. So to conclude, intelligent power can globally save thousands of lives, prevent tens of thousands of injuries and eliminate tens of billions of dollars in property damage every single year while significantly reducing global energy consumption in the spirit of this year's Ted Conference, we think this is a powerful world changing invention. I'd like to thank Chris for this opportunity to unveil

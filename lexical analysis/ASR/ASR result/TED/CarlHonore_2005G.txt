 time every moment of the day feels like a race against the clock to borrow a phrase from Carrie Fisher, which is in my bio there I'll just toss it out again these days even instant gratification takes too long and If you think about how we try to make things better what do we do? We speed them up don't we so you know we used to dial now we speed we used to read now we speed we used to walk now We speed walk of course we used to date now we speed date and Even things that are by their very nature slow We try and speed them up too. So I was in New York recently and I walked past a gym that had an advertisement in the window for a new course a new evening course And it was for you guessed it speed yoga So this is the perfect solution for time star professionals who want to you know sleep the sun But only want to give over about 20 minutes to it These are sort of the extreme examples in there and they're amusing and good to laugh at but there's a very serious point and I think that in the headlong dash of daily life we we often lose sight of Of the damage that this road runner form of living does to us We're so marinated in the culture of speed that we we almost fail to notice the toll it takes on every aspect of our lives on our health Our diet our work our relationships In the environment and our community and sometimes it takes a Wake up call doesn't it to to alert us to the fact that we're hurrying through our lives Instead of actually living them that we're living the fast life instead of the good life And I think for many people that wake up call takes the form of an illness You know a burn out or eventually the body says I can't take it anymore and frozen the towel or maybe a relationship Goes up and smoke because we haven't had the time or the patience or the tranquility to be with the other person to listen to them Now my wake up call came when I started reading bedtime stories to my son and I Found that at the end of the day I would go into his room and I just couldn't slow down. I mean I'd be speed reading the cat in the hat I'd be you know, I'd be skipping lines here paragraphs there sometimes a whole page Of course my little boy knew the book inside out So we would quarrel and what should have been the most relaxing the most intimate the most tender moment of the day when a dad Sit down to read to his son became instead this kind of gladiatorial battle of wills clash between his speed and my Or my speed and his loneliness And this went on for some time until I caught myself Scanning a newspaper article with time-saving tips for fast people and one of them made reference to a series of books called the one-minute bedtime story And I I I can I went saying those words now But my first reaction to time is very different my first week was to say how do you know? What a great idea this is exactly what I'm looking for to speed up that time even more but that thankfully A light ball went on over my head and my next reaction is very different and I I do a step back and I thought whoa You know is it really come to this am I really? It's such a hurry that I'm compared to fall off my son with a sound bite at the end of the day and I put away the newspaper and I I was getting on a plane and I sat there and I did something I hadn't done for a long time Which is I did nothing I

 to the bottom of the ocean and then I said to myself, I've just got to get this thought out of my mind as quickly as possible and the only way I can dive into that freezing cold water and swim a kilometer is by listening to my iPod and really revving myself up, listening to everything from beautiful opera all the way across to Puff Daddy and then committing myself 100% there is nothing more powerful than the made up minds and then walking up to the edge of the ice and just diving into the water and that swim took me 18 minutes and 50 seconds and it felt like 18 days and I remember getting out of the water and my hands feeling so painful and looking down with my fingers and my fingers were literally the size of sausages because you know we're made part of water when water freezes it expands and so the cells and my fingers had frozen and expanded and burst and the most immediate thought when I came out of that water was the following I'm never ever going to do another cold water swim in my life again anyway last year I heard about the Himalayas and the melting of the and the melting of the glaciers because of climate change I heard about this lake Lake Imja this lake has been formed in the last couple of years because the melting of the glacier the glaciers gone all the way up the mountain and left in its place this big lake and I firmly believe that what we're seeing in the Himalayas is the next great big battlegrounds on this earth nearly two billion people so one in three people on this earth rely on the water from the Himalayas and with an increasing with a population increasing as quickly as it is and with the water supply from these glaciers because the climate change decreasing so much I think we have a real risk of instability nor if you got China, South you got India, Pakistan, Bangladesh all these countries and so I decided to walk up to Mount Everest the highest mountain on this earth and go and do a symbolic swim underneath the summit of Mount Everest now I don't have any of you had the opportunity to go to Mount Everest but it's quite a no deal getting up there 28 great big powerful yaks carrying all the equipment up onto this mountain I don't just have a my speed up but there's a big film crew who then send all the images around the world the other thing which was so challenging about this swim it's not just the altitude I wanted to do the swim at 5,300 meters above sea level so it's right up in the heavens very very difficult to breathe you get altitude sickness it feels like you got a man standing behind you with a hammer just hitting your head all the time that's not the worst part of it the worst part was this year was the year where they decided to do a big cleanup operation on Mount Everest many many people have died on Mount Everest

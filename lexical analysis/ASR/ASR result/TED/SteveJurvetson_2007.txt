 know where black rock desert would be dangerous things happen and the boys get bigger and the rockets get bigger and they use motors that literally use uncruznessal boosters they rumble the valley and leaving photographers in awe watching this spectacle these rockets use experimental motors like natural stock side they use solid propellant most frequently it's a strange kind of love we have a rocket mavericks dot com website with my photos if you want to learn more about this participate the spectator mavericks we had to call it rocket mavericks this one was great went to a hundred thousand feet but didn't quite actually went eleven feet to the solid clay became a bunker buster drilling down into the clay had to be dug out rockets often spiral out of control if you put too much proponent here was a drag race at night you can see what happened in a second daytime column lens sharks sometimes they just explode before your eyes and come down supersonic to take this shot I do as I what I often do is go way beyond the pads when under the spectators aren't looking on the video I'll show you what it took to get this dream work shot this is rare here really like computer failed they're yelling at the way though this is when they realize everything on board is okay what is it? and I'll just like and that's me over there taking photos the whole way things often go wrong some people watch this event because of an ask our like assassination with things not being grinding burning the parachute as it fell that was last weekend this guy went up with supersonic ripped the fin canoff the arcs out on the sky and a burning metal hunk coming back these things would drop down from above all through the weekend of rocket launch after rocket launch after rocket launch it's a cadence you can't quite imagine and in many ways I try to capture the mishaps is the challenge in photography when these things all take place in a fraction of a second why do they do it for things like this gene from Alabama drives out there with this rocket that he's built x-ray sensors video cameras astundal electronics and he succeeds getting to 100,000 feet leaving the atmosphere he's seen the fin blue line of space it is this breathtaking image success of course that motivates us and motivates kids to follow and understand rocket science to understand the importance of physics and math and in many ways to sort of have that awe and exploration of the frontiers beyond that thank you

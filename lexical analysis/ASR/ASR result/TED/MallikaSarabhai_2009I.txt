 and proceeded to rape her. Then Indra disappeared and the woman's husband, the Brahmin, appeared. He realized at once what had happened. So he petitioned the higher gods so that he may have justice. So the god Vishnu arrived. Are there any witnesses? Just a one-eyed monkey, Sathaparam. Now, the one-eyed monkey really wanted for the woman ascetic to get justice. So she and we told events exactly as they had happened. Did he do this? Vishnu gave his judgment. The god Indra has sinned. In that year, sinned against a Brahmin. May he be called to wash away his sins. So Indra arrived and performed the sacrifice of the horse. And so he transpired that a horse was killed. A god was made sin-free. A Brahmin's ego was appeased. A woman was ruined. And a one-eyed monkey was left. Yep. Yep. Very confused at what we humans call justice. In Indra, there is a rape every three minutes. In India, only 25% of rapes come to a police station. And all these 25% that come to the police station, convictions are only 4% of the disc. That's a lot of women who don't get justice. And it's not only about women. Look around you. Look at your own countries. There is a certain pattern in who gets charged with crimes. If you're in Australia, it's mostly Aboriginal's world. If you're in India, it's either Muslims or Avivasi's are tribal. It's the Maxxelites. If you're in the US, it's mostly the blacks. There is a trend here. And the Brahmins and the gods, like in my story, always get to tell Dutch as the truth. So have we all become one-eyed, two-eyed, incident one-eyed monkeys, have we stopped seeing injustice? Good morning. You know, I have told this story close to 550 times in all the cases.

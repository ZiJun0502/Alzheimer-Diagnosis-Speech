 Oh, I write with the pencil often. But mostly with a pen. Tree. The tree is beautiful. My child had to go to the hospital. This winter has not been very cold. Chair, doctor, and sit. I sit on a chair in the doctor's office. Or I sat at the chair and talked to the doctor. I will go to the bureau and open the drawer.

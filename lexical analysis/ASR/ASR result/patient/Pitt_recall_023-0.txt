 Well, he took you to use a granddaughter, wouldn't it be? To see your far home. It's a long returning home. You see how long it's been training you? It is. Not only that it took you on this trip to the city to see their former home and she was a great, a great, amazing city. And she made the trip. Thank you. You know, I'll have to learn this. Yay, we're happy.

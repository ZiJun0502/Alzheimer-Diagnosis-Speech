 I do. Sure, all the big joints up there on the heel front. I think they've got maybe more joints in there. They did all kinds of work out there. Our country for any kind of what's called floor work and it has to be a professional. Squeeze the juice in there and it's better stayed there for years. Somebody tries to get it, it breaks it up. You tell me about it. If they get any damage while you're on top of the clopper there, you can put them to play. That's the only way you can do it. I guess it's properly there. Here? Well, up the top of the hill and then you can go around up into the mountain. There? Well, yeah. We got some of it. Just a few views over there and others are being there, being here, for putting the plate. You get together and you are lying. Tell them what you want. I've got about six, seven, eight. I do it by myself. I want to. Or I can get somebody to help. They ain't anybody. They can put the stuff in there. On the inside. I can shut off all the gear. This is all handled by the watcher. See for one side. Yeah, how's the first day beyond at the watcher? That's the joint. They came in from under. Well, I got there mostly scattered around. One or two of them. Now, over here, I'm over here, maybe, just something up on the mountain. He's working there for a company company. He was either with the heat pumps or the same thing. Yeah, he carries that stuff around and builds it up for him. They get money, you know? The middle one, you know, still too small. Call us or say, daddy or anything. Yeah, sure. Now, they have talked and they get to play it. I think they lost it. My folks came in from under. They came in on the brush. The elephant even went in there. Right in there, your heart is on the phone. The starry mountain, building and building and building up there too. I worked with dad there while I was just a kid. I was just a kid just this long, you know? We had a lot of teens over there that got in and stole a lot of stuff from the man that people had worked in there. Yeah, sure. They pushed their ways into the country. They were all, sure. We knocked them off. They finished them off. That's where they shoved us. The teens over here, we had American drum boys, you know, that were real teens. They robbed us all over. We had the priestful sort of thing that robbed off too and couldn't get anything done. And the man that we're working for, for the two people, couldn't get anything done because they ran off with a lot of stuff. And after we got in there with dad, you know, I was just a kid. You know, I was just a kid. I was just born right there and the thing wasn't long. It took us down to a aisle there, a aisle area. He started a work over there. He wasn't long, he had a picture of a few, much closer. He was a kid in the middle of the head. Right the time I got my lunch call up, my work that I was in. He sent me into school that was miles away. I had to get on the other side of the house. I thought that the carry is through where we had it. He was a thing. We had to catch this, the watchman, the treats, rolling up and down. We had to catch one that had a foot in the house. If you didn't get your work in by the time you got to, we were just one mile away from the house, you know, from our own house. We were going to take care of the business on there. Sometimes we got too much of it. And we had to jump that. So by the time we got cleaned up and everything else, and got away from me and dad was working there. I did. He's gone through a long time. I was only one that was born in the area where they shipped it off. Now there was just about this much of a place over there. And it didn't do us any good because we couldn't jump through there. They'd still stolen everything away from the people that were working there. He was a Hungarian priest. I was a baby. I was just a baby yet. And I got into there with the family and they stole everything from the mother and mother. We did a thing that they, we had a bit there and was able to catch some guys like that. They'd been dead longer. I took a lot of this stuff, a wall covering and everything all around. You'll see all the stuff that went around. You don't put nothing on the floor. You've got to put a push-on. You've got to put your bottom seat and you pull it off and then you come back to the fence. You just drop them in there. You're all there, you're going to put it in because that's moisture. Because you'd be losing it all the time. You have to work with it.

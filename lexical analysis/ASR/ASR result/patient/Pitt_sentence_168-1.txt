 I'm going to write a letter to my daughter. The leaves are falling from the tree. The child went to the hospital. Is it alright? I hate winter because there's snow on the ground. We went to the doctor and the child did not want to sit on the bed. Is that alright? Is that enough? No. I want to sit on his table. Close the door because I want to get dressed. No, I just have a door. I don't know. It's half David.

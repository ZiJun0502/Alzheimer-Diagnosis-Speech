 Sure, this is a picture, apparently, of a family, a small family in this specific case. There's a mother at the sink. They're probably in the kitchen, I would think. And she's at the sink doing some cleaning of the dishes. There's a little bit of a flood from the sink, because perhaps it was too high. But she doesn't seem to snage. She's just doing her thing. And that's it. And the children behind her, they're preteens. There's a boy and a girl. They look very happy and they look very busy, except that the little boy, as many little boys are. Little careless, he's on the stool and looks like it's going to fall. He's going to fall over. But he's reaching for the jar and has achieved getting it and probably will help himself to some jam or whatever it contains. His little sister, perhaps younger than he, is concerned a bit. She wants to extend her hand to help them and give them inspiration. I think that makes a good relationship between brother and sister.

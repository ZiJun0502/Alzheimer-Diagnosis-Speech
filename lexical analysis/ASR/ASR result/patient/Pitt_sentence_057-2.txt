 I dropped the pencil on the floor. We have the most beautiful tree in our backyard. Child hospital. I went to see my girlfriend in the child's hospital. This has been a cold winter this year. What was that? The doctor told her to sit. I went and opened the bureau drawer to get my skirt off. Did I really make it? I don't mind these.

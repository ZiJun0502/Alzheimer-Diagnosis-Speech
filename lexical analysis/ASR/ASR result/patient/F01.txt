 I see a family, a mother washing the dishes and the sink is flowing over. And that's floating on the floor of the water, flowing over. And meanwhile she's not paying attention to the kids. They're stealing out of the cookie jar and the son is flowing over. He's coming off on the chair he's standing on. And the daughter, waiting for the younger daughter, is waiting to try to get help with herself. She's getting the giver, her sister, some cookies. There's a scene outside the window. It's a dull, normal yard. I can't say anything different, but it is amazing that she's not paying attention to the water flowing over the floor. I see a lot of attention that the boy is definitely going to get hurt because the chair is falling over.

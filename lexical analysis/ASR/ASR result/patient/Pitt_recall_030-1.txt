 Okay. That's it. Here you go. Oh, George. Just after Thanksgiving, George Miller visited with his granddaughter, Melanie. She asked to visit the place where he was born and they went off to it. And she was frightened by the noises in the street. It was the fourth July that Uncle Bill returned to the States and the whole family was happy to see him especially. So, his nephew, Billy, he enjoyed the memory of their fishing, especially the trout fishing more than anything else. And he returned to the family. He returned. Everyone had missed him. The family greeted him. He was especially welcomed by his nephew, Billy, with whom he spent a pleasureful times fishing, a trout fishing more than anything else. I think that's all I can call. No, I'm afraid I'll call Billy didn't have a fishing session.

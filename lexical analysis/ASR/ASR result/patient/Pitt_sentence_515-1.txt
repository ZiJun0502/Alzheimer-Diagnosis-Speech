 We were not the other day for a walk and looked for the pretty trees. Is trees alright or simply just tree? They took Harry's baby girl, Carol, to the hospital yesterday. What was the word? Hospital? The other one? Okay. I think we used a word five, child. I went and used a name instead of something. I didn't do it right. I don't think. Did I? I don't know. Okay. Be careful when you go out. It's cold out there because this is a winter day. It's a bit... Oh gosh. When you go to doctors, you have to sit on the chair. What was the other word? Chair and doctor and sit. That's right. When you go to the doctors, you have to sit on that chair. That chair or something. Point to it. Open. Absolutely. Okay. Now, please open the door on the viewer for me. That's how to dump for me at the end. Please open for me. You know, you should say it a different way.

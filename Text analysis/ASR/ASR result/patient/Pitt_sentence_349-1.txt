 If I bought the pencil or pencil, I have a writing pencil. The tree is full of fruit. Child hospice. Child hospice. Little little girl is in the child hospital. We had a very cold winter. Chair, doctor sick. And you make a sentence out of it. Child, doctor the sit and share. The drawer is open. Or someone's mother will write.

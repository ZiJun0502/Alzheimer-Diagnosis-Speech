 You're going, the reason I'm laughing is which one do I choose? Well, one that stands out there is, I don't know if you're familiar with the things that happen when a Jewish boy is 13 years old and he's called up to the Bema for his Bar Mitzvah and it's sort of a proud moment for you're the center of attraction and you're it and you say your portion that you spent months learning and that sort of brings you as so called into the fold and that's just that hit me just right now there that going back that going back to 70 ideas. I remember that being called up yeah it was down on down on St Andrew Street, Afsperine at just north of Dundas, there's the synagogue there in the old synagogue and they called up my name there to come up and say my portion. Isn't that funny how struck you 70 years ago and still remembers in the back of the head? Well, when I get up I come down, I make myself my breakfast, whatever it is, I get washed, dressed, and I brush my teeth and with the weather is nice outside, I take myself ready like a few work here, I'd be ready to take myself a walk around the block to come around this way here which would take about 15 minutes or so there to sort of get myself loosened up so I have to do it after you leave. I take it from there and as if what if I get hungry later in the afternoon I have a light snack and this supper is usually prepared ahead of time there that I had taken under the fridge or of Carol's here or wherever if I'm at her house for supper or what and to make my day and I usually read the paper that comes in and I watch some do some use some television at night there and make my day the best way I can to fill it up whether wise sort of creates the day, whether I'm out or I'm in okay the boy is kicking the football the ball anyways and it's landing into the center of the TV or into the into the window breaking the window and coming into the lap of the gentleman sitting in the chair opposite the window and he's looking outside there he has the ball in his hand and he's looking out there who who smooth a ball through the window a little boy the mother is teaching the little boy that he has to take the umbrella when it starts to rain outside so he goes outside and he gets all wet and he's all soaked wetting and he comes back into the house soaking wet there then he comes with the umbrella then he goes out again the cat got stuck up on the tree or just went up into the tree and the little girl couldn't get the cat down and the man the father I guess you would call him try to get up the tree he did with the ladder but the ladder fell down I couldn't get down and they got the fire engine the fire department the fire department and the dog was barking at the into the tree and the fire engine came with the fireman there and they got the ladder to bring him down well since the river was far as I remember was a major helper in the family where there was I don't remember three or four children and there happened to have been a ball a dance a big dance and she was the housekeeper that was the maid of the thing and everybody used to boss her around does like they do here like they say here and uh but she was never invited to the ball basically because she wasn't one of the uh I shouldn't separate the dog okay she was the she was the maid and the helper in the house there so she wasn't invited to the ball okay well okay let's go here she was the maid and she used to do all the chores in the house and do the maintenance and everything there and uh if I remember right there the wicket which right she wasn't invited to the ball and uh was it that Prince Prince charming there that uh and the wicket which there she helped address his daughters there in order for them to go to the to the ball and uh when the with the angel sort of the good one came along there and got and made to check what we the magic wand and dressed her into the into the beautiful dress there that she was and the prince and the prince and she was invited she got to the ball how she got there I don't remember but uh oh yeah and to the magic chariot there with driven by the six white horses that I remember and uh she made she waved the magic wand and she was dressed to go to the to the big and she was driven to the to the to the to the ball and all the the prince and saw her there and he took her and he danced with her and then the story ends there she lost her slipper on the step going home and she was had to be home before before she turned back into the uh person that she was originally and she had to be she was the maid again there and I remember the story the prince went around from close to place to try to find who who where she lost the slipper there and to see who fitted the slipper and the prince found found her that she was the one and he asked to marry her and she began the princess the tour bus is coming to the town the tour bus is coming into the town to pick up the people the tour bus is coming into the town to pick up the people who were swimming ice cream tastes good in the summer I just had some last night beautiful flowers something beautiful woman the man saw the boy at the dog the man saw the dog that the boy chased oh i just i was thinking something i hope starting to say it again okay bad weather was caused by an airplane today couldn't be should be the plane was delayed by but by bad weather

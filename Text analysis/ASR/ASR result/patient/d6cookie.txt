 The children are taking jammer jelly or something from the jar and the little fella is about 4.4 on the floor and mom is washing dishes. That's the overall, instead of the dish water on the floor. If you see your mom is open, she's talking and not paying attention. That's about all I could think of. Somebody's doing one of the children about to climb or something like this one. He's one. My teacher should be here and they throw me out the door. She's asking a mother for a cookie. It's very easy. Very well done. You know, by a single jar, I mean, a single pencil or whatever they're using.

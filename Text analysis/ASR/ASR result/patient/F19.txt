 Looks like people in the kitchen, women, mother, maybe around four to three. Fourteen. Water's running out of the 19 good-ish. Kids falling over. Where the bloodbed? I heard it. Kind of fall on the floor. Yeah. Girls. You stick. Looking at them. I asked for laughing at them. Oh, I sure. The kitchen's right there. I think that's your black shirt. I paid pretty much it.

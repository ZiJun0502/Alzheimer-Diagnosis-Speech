 I know I don't want to be in the kitchen, that's your shore. Like what's going on, I guess. Well, the kids trying to get the cookies out of the cookie jar. He's going to hurt himself because he's going to fall on the ground because he's going to go off the chair that he's on. Mom is not paying any attention to the fact that the water is going all over the floor. The wind is wide open, anybody could come in if they wanted to. So it doesn't seem that anybody's minding the store, so to speak, in this home. I would think that mom and dad need to get together and have little chats about what the kids do when they get on the floor. That could be my fault.

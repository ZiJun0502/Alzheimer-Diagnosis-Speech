 Thinking back, I remember the story of when I came to this country and we had to hide from the military. So we took a train and before we got to the final station at the train slowed down and the conductor came around to warn any of those who were going to be migrants or refugees in the future and we snuck off the train on the wrong side of the road and we had to hide and we had to wait until the whole the train passed by and the crowd left and then we were squatting down and very slowly, very carefully we had to kind of squatting down and go and we weren't crawling but almost and then we had to get into the fields and behind some trees until we were hoping nobody could see us and then somebody there were many of us, not just my family and then somebody started yelling watch out the Russians are there and we all squatted down and lay down and it was kind of snowy on the ground but we just lay down and we could see the shadow of the tip of their the 90 part of their of their gods and it was standing still and sometimes moving a little bit now we could see is the shadow of that so everybody was laying down and we stayed there which seemed like an eternity and nobody was there in to move and the thing was still we could see if but it never moved away until one of the people that I didn't know or our family didn't know started crawling around to take a look as to why these soldiers weren't going anywhere and eventually it turned out that the shadow they saw was really just the shadow of a very tall pine tree the tip of it and it was being blown by the wind and it was moving just a little bit and there were no soldiers there at all and we were able to move on well it varies it starts by my cat waking me up and sort of tapping me on the shoulder or on the face because she thinks it has to she has to get out and hopefully that doesn't happen before six o'clock in the morning if that happens at six o'clock in the morning if it happens before I just don't get up I sure are aware if it's six o'clock in the morning I get up I let her out and I get my morning started just in case I get a call to go to supply in a school I can get that call if I get me get up the night before I can get that call between six and seven each seven thirty the latest the later than that and then it starts to get too late if I get a call then I either way I rush around and hop into the shower while the cat is outside and it doesn't bother me in the shower and I take my shower get myself world less ready and sometime during that time even if the school hasn't called me I hear scratch scratch scratch that's the cat and I let her back in at which point by this time her dish is sitting there hopefully and she starts to eat so I eat the cat and don't let her out just in case I get a call from school if I don't get a call from school then it becomes a little bit boring but either way I get my coffee the meantime the coffee has been ready from the night before and all I have to do is push the button and it perks itself and I get my coffee and I try to get myself ready just in case I get a call and it's rush rush rush and then all of a sudden it becomes say eight o'clock and nobody called me I don't go anywhere then I start something breakfast etc. I want to hear any more of my day okay so if I get the call for school then I'm still rushing and I have to be up the door by about eight because I have to get to the school by eight thirty okay so if I get to the school then they just set out what I have to do for the day if I don't get a call for school then by eight o'clock I'm pretty sure that I'm not going to get a call by eight thirty I'm definitely sure at that point you know by now I will have a few dishes in the sink because I have hopefully had my bowl of cereal with some fruit in it and now the cat is biting me at the ankle wanting to go out and I usually don't let her out right away until I'm 100% sure that I don't get called otherwise she'd be out and I'll be gone and it's not a good scene so if it's eight thirty and I didn't get anything any calls then I start my day and it depends on what I have planned or what I have possibilities on Mondays and Wednesdays if I don't get called in I have a group to join two different groups both of them involve you know just hold hook with bokeh women doing stitching or or various needlework and gabbing and gossiping and whatever in a community center two different kind of community center one is really close by one is far away so I would have to go in both ways I go in the car but and that sort of takes still almost noon somewhere in the middle of that there is a coffee break and one of them is racco king one is called stitch and bitch so in other words you can bring any kind of any kind of needlework or or beads or whatever and then I get home and I have something for lunch the one on Wednesdays we go out for lunch usually so that takes a lot longer and you know then I end up with leftovers and that's good for supper the same day or whatever you know next day lunch something like that and beyond that to be honest with you there isn't enough structure in my day at this point in time to really make it flow so one of the things about I mean I know how to how to put it together I will explain that to you but I'm not crazy about peanut butter and I have diabetes so the jelly is off okay however to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich for my grandson okay I would take out well first of all I would go to the cupboard and grab the cup I would grab the bread and that might be on the kitchen counter or it might be in the fridge and then I would grab the peanut butter from the top shelf and I would grab the jam or jelly from the fridge and I take out the knife and I grab a plate and I spread my okay open the bread unwrap the bread I don't know how detailed you want me to surprise unwrap the bread and I'm careful to close the bread up again and I spread first of all I I opened the jar of peanut butter and I spread some peanut butter on the bread and I get a spoon from the drawer and scoop some jelly for jam and spread it onto the sandwich and then I cut it in half the bread cut it in half and I don't close it up I don't put them together because I'm gonna get off yucky and squishy so I just serve them open face and hopefully it is for my grandson which I wouldn't eat the stuff I would pour a juice and I would set it all down okay so this guy's name is Joey and he's playing outside and and as kids would you know he's kicking the ball and lo and behold the ball is like a magnet and gets kicked right against the window of the neighbor's house and crashes to the window and as it crashes through it knocks not only does it break the window it knocks things over on the inside and crashes things up and breaks things inside the house of the neighbor and now the neighbor is he was watching television and he now has the soccer ball and he's looking out to see what who threw the ball or who kicked the ball do I clip this over or no or just tell a story okay so this is mom and um little boy Albert he is going to school and mom says take the umbrella with you and Albert says no I don't want the umbrella and mom says you taking that umbrella you are taking the umbrella because it's gonna rain and sure enough darn it all sure enough it starts raining and Albert did not take the umbrella he left it by the front door just inside the front door and snuck out and sure enough it's now raining and he is getting pretty darn soky bat and um runs back home and says mom I need the umbrella and mom's getting pretty cross and says you keep this up and you're not going to the soccer game tomorrow and he says no no mom I I'll take the umbrella I'll take the umbrella I go back to school and can I please go to the soccer game tomorrow so he goes off and mom said yes oh yeah okay so um there was a cat and the cat's name was Per and Per liked being outside and um really what was happening the next door neighbor had a dog and the dog's name was Chao Chao and Chao Chao love chasing cats or anything that run around so sure enough what happened is Chao Chao went and started running after the cat the cat got up on the tree and not only did it get up on the tree but it got out on such a far far end of the branches that he was stuck he was actually really stuck and this cat used to belong to a girl named Susan and Susan was yelling and crying my cat is up on a tree my cat is up on a tree daddy daddy would you please get the cat off the tree and daddy went and got the ladder but what really happened is when he started climbing up there the dog was still barking and the dog knocked the ladder over and now daddy was stuck on the tree and the cat was stuck on the tree and there was a neighbor who's a nosy neighbor and he saw the bull darn thing and he phoned the the fireman and the fireman actually had to come out and save him and bring another ladder because his ladder was down everybody was crying and yelling and screaming and barking and the neighbors were getting a little nervous and irritated and so it but he had to pay for the charge of the fire truck coming out okay so Cinderella was she was she was living with her stepmother and two two step sisters who were not very kind to her not not any of them were very kind to her and there was a big ball that was supposed to be happening and so everybody was getting ready to go to the ball and oh what she was being used as a really as a servant picking up after herself a step sister and her stepmother and so there was a ball that was being arranged and all the step sisters were getting ready to go to the ball and they weren't inviting her at all and she wasn't going to get to go and interestingly enough I can't remember how the heck she got hold of a nice dress but she was touched by a magic wand and her her beautiful her poor dress turned into a beautiful pink dress and she had lovely shoes on and everything was really gorgeous and the prince saw her and ignored the two other sisters or rather step sisters and just wanted to be with her but then just before midnight she was supposed to have to run away because the magic godmother said you have to disappear at midnight because everything will turn back into normal and your beautiful dress and your beautiful clothes will be back to the poor little um um stop that you were wearing originally so just before midnight she started running away and um the prince was trying to catch her and was looking to see her and she ran down the stairs and as she was running away she lost one shoe and as she stopped on the steps and she kept running because she knew that she had to disappear and so she went back to her little huddle cabin where she was being kept and her clothes and everything turned back to her normal, meant itself and um with the exception of the one shoe that got left behind and so the prince decided that he was going to find the young lady that he wanted to dance with he wanted to be with and he went around the countryside checking out all the ladies and trying wishing to find the person that lost this shoe and of course he got around to the castle of um or the house of where Cinderella, her stepmother and her two step sisters lived and Cinderella was just cleaning around and being very you know domesticated and um he went and tried the shoes on everybody and as the story would go the shoes were too small for everybody, too small for each of the step sisters and as we in our heads know that small feet are wonderful okay anyway so the shoe just would not fit on anybody and finally um he said but I know that there is somebody else here and you learn to show me every girl has to try it on in the whole country, everybody everybody and then they dragged her out from the back of the kitchen saying oh well she's got to try it on too and he tried on the shoes and tiny they were but her feet were small and it fit in the manate fit you know that was the magic moment and uh so he chose her and you know married her and they they've tightly ever after and then talking the beautiful carry the two of us is coming into the town to pick up the people from the hotel the two of us is coming into the town to pick up the people to go swimming, mad at her with her glass caused by a long and flainted layers,

 Well, there's a boy out playing kicking a ball. Unfortunately, it goes through a window, glass window, and lands beside a man in a house. I don't know if there's somebody that is on, but that is also a lack of a lamp over. Anyway, he picks the ball up and goes outside. I guess the sea won't kick him. There's a lady or another hand in an eye. An umbrella to a child. Child doesn't want it, but he goes out in the rain and discovers that it's pretty wet. Well, he starts to cry and he's unhappy. I don't know if he had the umbrella with him. He ends up having an umbrella, and he's quite content. Oh, boy. Oh, this is a little girl. I guess it's her kitten who's gone up in the tree. And this, for maybe her father, goes out and tries to retrieve it, but he had lost the ladder, which he'd used to get up on. And they had to call the third apartment to rescue him. Oh, wow. The long time ago. She had read that. I know she used to work. She did a lot of household chores. And she had a. What you would call her, someone that looked over, you know, was in charge. It was not very nice to her. And. I remember her losing one of her slippers. And she had to go through the process, or the process. This prince, she met this prince. He had been involved with him, and then I guess he was looking for her. And he said, whoever split it into the slipper was Cinderella. I guess that he was looking for.

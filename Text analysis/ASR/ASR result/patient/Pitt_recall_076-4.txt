 Oh, dear. You see, I'm in almost my 90s and I forget things from way, way back. You see, I've forgotten because I didn't get the whole thing as fast as I should or as good as I should. Well, I've sort of forgotten what they were doing. That's more problem. I'm afraid I don't remember it. I'm sorry. Okay. There's about a girl and then a man that was going to come into the picture. I would think it would be sometime in the middle of the year or not the cold or the real hot. I'm afraid I don't. What stories they were. What's George's last name? Melanie's hand. Well, I'm sure that she was very happy to be with him. I presume that he is happy to have her with him. She probably been in the country. That was how beautiful it is. It is a thing. She thinks it's safer in our big city. You know, you have to be careful not to get hit by a car or something. Nobody's trying to hurt you, but the busy, busy people in the morning, my goodness, I just dashed to get to their work.

 Well, Uncle Bill had returned on July 4th and he met his young nephew Bill who was so happy to see him because of their friendship when he was young and what he especially remembered was their fishing crit. Oh yeah, Bill retired at the States in the spring and he met his friend Bill who was glad to see him back because they had been fishing buddies.

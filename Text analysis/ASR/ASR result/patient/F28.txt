 I'm not afraid. Just tell me what's going on, like what you see in the picture. I see the mother washing dishes. Trying to help the son who's falling down. I'm not on that picture. Yeah. I know. You're off to get now. Do you need a putty now? Yeah. Okay. All right, but it's a block of that. Yeah, I do it. She's built some water. Yeah. It's amazing. Very, very, very. They're going into the, they're going into the garbage. They're going to get caught. The other one's trying to help a catch the stuff that comes out. Get to know a bell. So nothing breaks. Two or three. The mother is paying no attention to them at all. Right there. Your welcome. You're in the kitchen, but you can't move. Take a lot of things. I think that the stove is over that way. Yeah. That's what I would say. Boom, boom, boom. But there's no boys. There's no girls. So that one woman took the time out. They look like they're the same ages. There's always for things to be put down there, you know, underneath. The drapes are pulled so they're not open. These guys are going to get in trouble some time. Because they're that right page. No girls, no girls. I don't see them. Just a button. They're trying out, they're bad in stuff but it's no way. This one, jars. This one's trying to catch them. There's no color. It's all white. Clothing is all white. Here on the boys is a little darker. The kitchen is all white. I'm sorry. I'm over slept. I'm the person. The mother's cleaning but trying. She didn't do it so well. Anything else? That's a help trying.

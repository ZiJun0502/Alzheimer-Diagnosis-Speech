 That right after Thanksgiving there was this little girl and her grandmother used to tell our stories all the time And one day They went to the city Your surface the day you can't remember That doesn't come in with the apple or anything that's different. I Might be mixing grandmothers, but I think the grandmothers went on came on Thanksgiving day and they had the Children out and snow and I forget where they took that boy or girl today Take It's all I can think of The December the holidays Story His his young years and he was young I Don't know Not if I didn't know he did Mm too much noise.

 What is really amazing to me when I drive along the country roads is how many trees have fallen and they're just laying there and nobody's picking them up. They could use them. Yes, I can. And I'm running out of firewood right now. That's what makes me sick. Yeah, or using themselves, you know, amazing. Child and hospital. The amazing thing about hospitals and children is I hate to see the little kids be in hospitals. And there was that little boy just yesterday. He died. He was a couple of weeks old. Just about two weeks old. His heart, the replacement they put in his heart. Cold and winter should be in the same sentence. Okay, I hate the coldness that goes along with winter. Oh my, do I hate it? Here, doctor and sit. I hate to sit in a doctor's office. Do you agree? Yes, how about these three words? Put these three words in a sentence. Bureau, open and drawer. You know, in a bedroom, you need a bureau and you need a drawer because that's where you have your underwear.

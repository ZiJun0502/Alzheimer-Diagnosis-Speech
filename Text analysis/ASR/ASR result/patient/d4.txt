 I didn't say anything to any of my good I watched and I saw they were going and I've been in nickel They would if I ever because chance many of those people find out They were like oh I went over where we went over to see them things high in the mountains sky Of course, the july of a piece of it like a something was it free And I hung on to it They helped a lot Well all the people the few people that were coming around some of the people that were here and some He had gone down there And it was hard part was going back later because we had to turn around and go back But the first is somehow the mid-foot the car in one place in Vigil Finding a way to run like this in a circle and found out where the place was able to get home here Maybe I just did that Well I think that there's a lot to that Animals are very very sensitive about things like that We ought to find more some of the animals we had here But some of them have kind of gone away. I don't know But I think some of the people that brought them up here or thought they were going to bring them They were, I mean they were at home and did things they had already Well, there's a dog that costs in the street right across from The back here over there house They and they seem to go And sometimes I watch because it's just right there Things have to do there or lunch and whatever it is you can see it And the animals there is There's quite a big job Well, with that cat that came in and we liked them and they stayed by No, well, I don't know it's one thing and the one thing I tried to do go up and get pulled at them and see how they were But I can't climb up into the trees and that steps too much I suppose they do But I don't know the only trouble Well, not the only trouble But I don't like to see a lady might just sit down hard to get in Does you have before you get into those various things Of course you can go way over and go way over and way over and climb up And go off out in the far hill I will have freedom A little bit, not very much my not the kind of gardening that my mama would have Like just sitting there and I was growing up We don't seem to do much really good. I didn't try to move some of the things but the princess I was looking Well, that's interesting. Somebody is dragging something across the house And he'd go up and I started to walk up here to see if you know what was really going to get done there and All right, this I stand I stood still and said nothing because I knew the people were running And I could hear the top We had to talk people talking way at the top Must have been up in the upper area above and another street, you know But I can hear sections of this what they did say I didn't really Stand there and watch it, you know, but I could see that we're quite a number and that they were very much active Very active and interesting and what they do. Let's see the thing But was interesting me most with the wood Because we're having the problem with the with the trees from down there right at this Street up into far up as we can go They raised cane if you don't get the trees that they want No, I don't think we got it all done We some man with him here and he worked hard. He did quite very well considering but it's and the people that Used to live Over here in the street moved and they went up here When they left their house that house was given up to somebody else They somebody else bought it and so then they went up here and they're ready to go Into a new situation If you want to see them you have to go and you have to walk over here and you have to walk up the hill And you have to go around like this and you have to go to find a place and all you do You sort of see this and you see the top of the car and automobile and you know that's probably The place where they live Well, I can actually get on the telephone and probably reach certain amount But it's too bad because it was just lovely To have them around the other no, well actually it is picture of my daughter well Pamela, but this isn't I guess this really isn't Pamela. I don't know They have different nicknames time to time She She's very clever and quick doing things she can do also She's Was just teaching and she she was the first one to In the time that they were starting a new teaching thing over in the valley and So and they brought it over down here too and she got on Thing with it and she was ended up She lives up high But the place where she ended up going was the lowest school In the city of Los Angeles One that day I was there and then she had left and I realized I got out over There's a place where there was something rug but it's like like the harsh Something that I'd have to move over and I realized that that is the difference between being in Los Angeles and being in another part of the California She said one or two things and one or two one She said the doctor come by and say she's she's she's she's she's she you're doing too much is too much for you You've got to have more rest Go home Get in the bed and just lie there and take a good rest and then you leave them Well, you know The same thing one of the things that this man I think knew quite a lot He did she did go home and lie down and rest and get something to change but It made a great deal of difference to her But one of the things that happened when the when she first went into that school to see what was happening She went in she went upstairs. They just said just go upstairs and that she was in charge of that That place But she hadn't told the children or anything when she just moved in and took it One of the girls took up a thing like this with glass and she Right with a piece of stuff along the side here and here and went across to where one of the other girls in the class had a broken glass And was trying to push it across the face of another one of the girls End of this room now she's gotten upstairs and it twisted around and it was hard and so forth And she'd grown in and said something or other Not that their head or something But here was this girl going around with broken glass in her hand But for like that and she was angry because somebody didn't like something that she had And I tell you Well Peter my daughter She couldn't stand that So the result was that she just took the top of the This what isn't it? I've forgotten what it was exactly. I was just there I was so upset and I stood up and found out Where she was she was Trying to stop this other woman and both of us were interested and Ultimately they got one of the Peter took one of them went downstairs where the principal was and got away from Peter and How and earth how she did I don't know but I know that she took the girl and Well just like that and took that girl Broken glass that she was you get down the other girl's face and knocked it down on the ground Well, she never done anything like that before but she did it that time You what would if would you do if your daughter came along and you know and somebody had a piece of glass or something that was they were good Broken one put it across her face for any decency in your Feeling about people and things that you could be doing You'd do something about ultimately I stayed around and they do on we went downstairs and And Peter my daughter is there nicknamed Peter and she went The girl was at the office told her to run Oh just take it turn the turn the thing over and you can go in he just go in now the principal was in there And so they she walked in finding because if they woman and told it they wanted to come in And when she got in there The good thing that was reason that she was sent there Because they the principal wanted to see what she had done And he had a whole line up of the thing that had been made by different people and she had made The best standing Anybody in the school Which meant that You were ready to go on into another layer you've got somehow to get these children Very young in way down towards the dark part in Los Angeles And some of them good deal with dark in them some of them not But the places where that you can go if you can keep working and Learning a little more and we're gonna have a chance to go up one more grave. You see his next time next semester You'll be in higher one It was interesting Whether it's at the same time is It really upset you Leached it's upset me Well ultimately we went downstairs with Peter that day and the heat He the door was left open And the nurse the nurse wasn't the nurse, but it was a woman there that could be in there And they said they wanted you to come in Ready guys now what we're gonna have so I stayed outside because it was you know none of my business And The And Laced there and stayed there And finally what I found out was that they were calling her in because she had the highest record She's gotten out of the children and see When the thought they were trying to do was to get to these children they were pretty low in their ability in knowledge so far and getting what they wanted Than to have and what the children often did want And so they were trying to get ready to get the girls It happened to be in that section They wanted to go on and do things and do nice things and They did the best they would be cleared to get something to get them to go out and do one more grave So I didn't hear much of anymore and I but I've seen pictures. She stayed but she's made pictures And she said they were my children. I don't care You see anything bad It's the only way you can do she About that you can get at some of them There are a lot of things they didn't have they didn't have any socks most of them and once some of them gave gave some of them some Socks and they could take a special trip and they could walk outside They did it once every month. There's a year maybe you know

 Melanie's grandfather told her about the house he lived in. And she convinced him to take her to see the house. And he took her by hand and went up to the house, but she was frightened by the noise and the traffic that they encountered. Forget it. No. It was a boy and his grandfather had a grandfather took him out for a walk. And he was to buy him candy here. But he didn't buy the flat. The grandfather didn't buy what he wanted. Period. That's all for it. Said close. Grandfather. What time of year? It was winter. Grandfather. My goodness. I didn't know he would not like the city. I was a traffic. He told her he had a cross-street time. I came back. She had no more care for me.

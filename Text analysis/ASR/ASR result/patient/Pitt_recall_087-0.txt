 The whole year just the fourth Thanksgiving George Miller moved him to his mistress, his son's family. He had a granddaughter in her home, and she was my hearing the stories she told me. This child's with him, and she knew she had to visit his home in the past four. So he took her to the city and held her back in hand, and always fighting her. She was very glad to be back at the end of the country again. George Miller moved in with his son's family just before Thanksgiving. He used to tell his granddaughter Melanie's stories of his child, and he said she'd like to see the home where he was born in the city. She took her in on talent, and she was very frightened and always fighting her back in the home again. She didn't tell him this but she was very glad to be back at the country again. Maybe so she wouldn't have lost anything. I remember that crash. Okay, great.

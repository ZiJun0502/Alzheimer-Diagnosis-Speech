 Well, it seems like, okay, the water pouring over is just a careless mistake. I know women's part, I don't think she's doing it on purpose. Now the kids standing up going for cookies, very natural, and possibly expose them to the danger because that's a stool that can go over. So, it, uh, right. I don't know what this girl is doing. Is she encouraging him or is she has her hands up saying, you know, don't, don't be doing what you're doing? I don't know. But I see the mother is tolerating the different problems. And, uh, I don't know if she's doing this on purpose. I don't think so. I think it's just getting so busy that she can't control the situation. I don't know about control. When I was woman, I was a big thing, especially if you were a mother or a father. You felt that you were better being controlled at all times. So, this is sort of, to be sort of, I said, open your phone. Like, something like this would happen, but it is logical.

 Well, you have a little boy that's gonna have a broken nose or something. This is when his mother is doing her little arm, her dishes and his sister's asking for a cookie. And I think I haven't had any real problems with my life. And I just keep on looking and keep on thinking. I'm sorry, but I'm just stuck right now with you. But anytime, anytime whatsoever, it would be great.

 right? Absolutely nothing. So it's just too much. It's too much of a... I don't know what... how can I say it? Distraction, I guess, I have here in that because I know... I guess in maybe it was like a zip... I know I'm not gonna see... I'm finishing. That's what you... your first thing is you're not gonna do it. I know that to myself. This is my reaction to what you asked me. It's already been answering questions for me. Yeah, but well, let me put it this way. Some things maybe and they might not be. So I'm trying to hang on to what I have and if I can hang on some certain things, I'm happy. And yeah, but some somewhere along the line coming around halfway there, somewhere, when you turn around and you see something wrong and it's... you know that there's your... this is what you're gonna be and that's what you're gonna be. Now if I can say something else, it's probably... maybe I don't know whether it's good or bad. When we go to that house of care, it's like as if you go in there with nobody saying anything to you, letting you along and not only that, but you do have company. Right? And I can go down and do what I want to down here and it's like you can go walk. Nobody says nothing. I mean, they say it, but they do. They do and say. And if there's any problems, what problem? You ain't got a problem. I don't even know what the story was. I mean, what was the story? No. I don't know what... I don't know what story was. I have no recollection of a story. It seems like that, but that's the part that I don't like. I think that this is what might happen and there might be like a part of my brain or something. I'm losing. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I'm answering nothing that I don't know.

 I mean, I should get you names. And then, I'm just taking a little girl to the city to show it to her. Come on. This little girl wasn't... I'm moving my things. Because it was a strange place, she wasn't too happy of being here. This was really, this back of the set, like you didn't know. It was just this. They were walking around and she wanted to go home. Or wherever her home was. Where she was. I think it's all like a real set that didn't go on outside. I don't have a name. I can't be... I know she wasn't pleased with what she was. And finally, the person did take her away from me. That immediate error.

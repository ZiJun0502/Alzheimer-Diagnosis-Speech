 I was the better at improvisation. You were the better at spinning the plate. I was the better at procrastination. You were the better at quiet debate. But who was the better man? Old mate. Who was the better man? You were the better at rolling a wreath. I was the better at coke and rum. Remember that night on the beach and the marriott with the tattooed bump. The two was the better man. Old chum. Who was the better man? Now we come down to it. Relatives grieving. Now in the hall with their crocodile tears. Now that you're out of it. Now that you're leaving. Now that they've sealed your eyes, such all ears. What I've been meaning that tell you for years and years and years and years and years. Old mate. Is that you were the better man in the end? You were the better man. My friend. I worked this next time for my mother. Everyone else had a mother. Only one. Probably the most important person in your life if you're lucky enough to know them. My mother was certainly the most important in mind. Let me try and to describe you to her to you. She's 86 years old. She's frail. Why? Why do they do that? Why do old ladies go to those hair shops and make those helmets? Bright as a button, all the ducks in a row. Looks like a much prettier version of margarit fatcher. But without any of the soft bits in margarits, that character. I wrote this poem for her. These are not my beliefs, but my mother has lived by this creed. All her life. Never go back. Never go back. Never return to the hordes of your youth. Keep to the track to the beaten track. Memory holds all you need of the truth. Never look back. Never look back. Never succumb to the gorgon stair. Keep to the track to the beaten track.

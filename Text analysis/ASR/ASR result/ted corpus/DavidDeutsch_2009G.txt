 No, they wished they knew how to prevent their food supply from sometimes failing, and how they could rest when they were tired without risking starvation. Be warmer, cooler, safer, less pain. I bet those prehistoric cave artists would have loved to know how to draw better. In every aspect of their lives, they wished for progress just as we do, but they failed almost completely to make any. They didn't know how to. Discoveries like fire happen so rarely that from an individual's point of view, the world never improved. Nothing new was learned. The first clue to the origin of starlight happened as recently as 1899 radioactivity. Within 40 years, physicists discovered the whole explanation expressed as usual in elegant symbols. But never mind the symbols. Think how many discoveries they represent. Nuclear eye and nuclear reactions of course, but isotopes, particles of electricity, antimatter, neutrinos, the conversion of mass to energy, that's E. MC2, gamma rays, transmutation. That ancient dream that had always eluded the alchemists was achieved through the same theory that explained starlight and other ancient mysteries and new unexpected phenomena. That all that discovered in 40 years had not been in the previous 100,000 was not for lack of thinking about stars and all those other urgent problems they had. They even arrived at answers such as myths that dominated their lives, yet almost no resemblance to the truth. The tragedy of that protracted stagnation isn't sufficiently recognized I think. These are people with brains of essentially the same design that eventually did discover all those things. But that ability to make progress.

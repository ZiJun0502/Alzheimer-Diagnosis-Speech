 A z Bengal, White people. There was a story I wouldn't tell you then But well, I'm feeling good right now I'd like to share that story today We are 7 children in my family All sisters accepting me This is me with my dad when I was a little boy Before I discovered the wonders of science I was just a simple farmer in a country of poor farmers Like everyone else, we grew mates One year our fortune turned very bad In 2001 we experienced an awful famine With the Infert Mass, all Malawians began to start to death My family ate one meal per day at night All in the three swarrows of Sima for each one of us The food passes through our bodies We dropped down to nothing In Malawi, second day of school, you have to pay school fees Because of the hunger, I was forced to drop out of school I looked at my father and looked at those dry fields It was the future I couldn't accept I feel very happy to be at the festival of second day of school So, I was determined to do anything possible to receive education So I went to a live rally I laid books, fast books, especially physics I couldn't read English that well I used diagrams and pictures to lend the weights along them Another book put that knowledge in my hands It said, win milk to pump water and generate electricity Pump water meant irrigation, a defense against hunger Which were experiencing by that time So, I decided I'll build one meal for myself But I didn't have materials to use So, I went to a strapyard where I found my materials Many people, including my mother, said I was crazy I found a tractor fund, a shotgun, PVC pipes Using a bicycle frame and a old bicycle dynamo I built my machine It was one light at best And then, four lights with switches And even a second breaker, module after an electric bell

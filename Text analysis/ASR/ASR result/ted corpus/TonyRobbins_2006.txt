 What is it that drives you in your life today? Not 10 years ago? Are you running the same path because I believe that the invisible force of Internal drive Activated is the most important thing in the world. I'm here because I believe emotion is the force of life All of us here have great minds, you know most of us here have great minds I don't know about any of the category, but we all know how to think with our minds We can rationalize anything we can make anything happen we can I agree with what was described a few days ago But this idea that people work in their self-interest, but we all know that that's bullshit at times You don't work in yourself interest all the time Because when emotion comes into it the wiring changes in the way it functions And so it's wonderful for us to think intellectually about how the life of the world is and Especially those are very smart. We can play this game in our head But I really want to know what's driving you and what I'd like to maybe invite you to do by the end of this talk is Explore where you are today for two reasons one so that you can contribute more and And two so that hopefully we can not just understand other people more but maybe appreciate and more and create the kinds of connections that can stop some of the challenges That we face in our society data only going to get Magnified by the very technology that's connecting us because it's making us Intercept and that intersection doesn't always create the view of everybody now understands everybody and everybody appreciates everybody So I've had obsession basically for 30 years and that obsession has been what makes the difference in the quality of people's lives What makes the difference in their performance because that's what I got hired to do I'm gonna produce the result now. That's what I've done for 30 years I get the phone call when the athlete is burning down on national television and they were head by five strokes And now they can't get back on the course. I got to do something right now. I get the result in nothing now I get the phone call when the child is gonna commit suicide and I got something right now and in 29 years I'm very grateful to tell you I've never lost one in 29 years. It doesn't mean I won't someday But I haven't done it and the reason is an understanding of these human needs. I want to talk to you now So when I get those calls about performance, that's one thing like how do you make a change? But also I'm looking to see what is it that shaping that person's ability to contribute to do something beyond themselves So maybe the real question is you know I look at life and say there's two master lessons one is there's the science of achievement Which almost every room is mastered to an amazing thing? That's how do you take invisible and make it visible right how you take what you dream out and make it happen whether it be your business Your contribution society money whatever it is for you your body your family But the other lesson of life that is rarely mastered is the art of fulfillment Because science is easy right know the rules you write the code you follow the and you get the result once you know the game You just you know you up the ante don't you? But when it comes to fulfillment that's an art and the reason is it's about appreciation and it's about contribution You can only feel so much by yourself So I've got an interesting laboratory try to answer the question of the real question Which is what's the difference in somebody's life that you look at somebody like those people that you've given everything to like all the resources They say they need you gave them not 100 dollar computer you give them the best computer you gave them love you gave them joy you were there to comfort them

 You can't get out. The two clips I want to show you the first one is a kind of Hodgepodge It's just three little moments four little moments with three of the people who are here tonight It's not the way they occur in the film because they're part of much larger scenes But they play off each other in a wonderful way and that ends with a little clip of my father of Lou Talking about something it was very dear to him which is the accidents of life And I think he felt that the greatest things in life were accidental and perhaps not planned at all And those three clips will be followed by a scene of Perhaps what to me is really his greatest building which is a building in Dhaka, Bangladesh He built the capital over there And I think you'll enjoy this building. It's never been seen We were the first it's been photographed still for still photographed But never been photographed by a film crew. We were the first film crew in there So you'll see images of this remarkable building a couple things to keep in mind when you see it It was built entirely by hand. I think they got a crane the last year and It was built entirely by hand off bamboo scaffolding people carrying these baskets of concrete on their heads dumping them in the forms It is the capital country and it took 23 years to build Which is something they're very seem to be very proud of over there as long as the Taj Mahal Unfortunately, it took so long that Lou never saw it finished he died In 1974 the building was finished in 1983 So it continued on for many years after he died And so think about that when you see that building that sometimes the things we strive for so hard in life We never get to see finished and that really struck me about about my father in the sense that he had such belief That somehow Doing these things giving in the way that he gave Something good would come out of it even in the middle of a war There was a world of Pakistan at one point and the construction stopped totally and he kept working This he felt well when the worst done. They'll need this building So those are the flip-flips of the show Roll the tape I Remember hearing him talk at 10 and I came home and I said to my father and mother I just met this man doesn't much work and he's sort of ugly Funny voice and he's a teacher at school. I know you've never heard of him But just mark this day that someday you will have you will hear of him Because he's a really an amazing man. I He had some kind of a fling with England bird You did it very lucky man Did you hear it really because he when he was in Rome He was a real nomad and you know when I knew him when I was in the office see what come in from a trip and be in the office with me

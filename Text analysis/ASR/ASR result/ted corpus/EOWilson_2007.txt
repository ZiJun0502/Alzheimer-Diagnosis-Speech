 mission on behalf of my constituency, which the 10 to the 18th power, that's a million trillion insects, and other small creatures, and to make a plea for them. If we were a wipe out insects alone, just that group alone, on this planet, which we are trying hard to do, the rest of life and humanity with it would mostly disappear from the land and within a few months. So how did I come to this particular position of advocacy? As a little boy through my teenage years, I became increasingly fascinated by the diversity of life. I had a butterfly period, a snake period, a bird period, a fish period, a cave period, and finally, and definitively, an ant period. My college years, I was a devoted dermatologist, a specialist on biology events, but my attention and research continued to make journeys across the great variety of life on earth in general, including all that it means to us as species, how little we understand it, and how pressing a danger that our activities has created for it. Out of that broader study has emerged concern and an ambition, crystallized in the wish that I'm about to make to you. My choice is the culmination of a lifetime commitment that, again, is growing up on the Gulf Coast of Alabama in the Florida Peninsula. As far back as I can remember, I was enchanted by the natural beauty of that region and the almost tropical exuberance of the plants and animals that grow there. One day when I was only seven years old and fishing, I pulled a pinfish that called the sharp, dorsal splines up too hard and fast and I blinded myself in one eye. I later discovered I was also hard of hearing, possibly congenitally, in the upper register soul and planning to be a professional naturalist. I never considered anything else in my entire life. I found that I had a loud-heeled bird watching and couldn't track frog holes

 thousand days all this stuff has come and I know that 10 years ago if I had told you that this was all coming you would have said that that's possible. It's simply there's no economic model that that would be possible and in fact told you it was all coming for free you would say this is simply you're dreaming you're a California utopian you're a wild out optimist and yet it's here. The other thing that we know about it was that 10 years ago as I looked at what even wired was talking about we thought it was going to be TV but better that was the model that was what everybody was suggesting was going to be coming and it turns out that that's not what it was. First of all it was impossible and it's not what it was. So one of the things I think we're learning if you think about Wikipedia it's something that was simply impossible it's impossible in theory but possible in practice and if you take all these things that are possible I think one of the things we're learning from this era from this last decade is that we have to get good at believing in the possible because I'm prepared for it. So I'm curious about what's going to happen the next 5,000 days but that's happened the last 5,000 days what's going to happen the next 5,000 days. So I have I have kind of a simple story and it suggests that that what we want to think about is this thing that we're making this thing has happened in 5,000 days that's all these computers all these handhelds all these cell phones all these laptops on servers basically what we're getting out of all these connections is we're getting one machine there is only one machine and our little handheld devices are actually just little windows into those machines but that we're basically constructing a single global machine and so I began to think about that and turned out that this machine happens to be the most reliable machine you've ever made it has not crashed it's running uninterrupted and there's almost no of the machine that you've ever made that runs the number of hours the number of days 5,000 days without interruption that's just unbelievable of course the internet is longer than this 5,000 days the web's 5,000 days so I was trying to basically make measurements where the dimensions of this machine and I started off by calculating how many billions of clicks there are all around the globe on all the computers and there's 100 billion clicks per day and there's 55 trillion links between all the web pages of the world and so I began thinking more about other kinds of dimensions and I made a quick list and was it Jordan the photographer talking about numbers being so large the meaning less well here's a list of them they're kind of hard to tell but there's one billion PC chips on the internet count all the chips and all the computers on the internet there's two million emails per cent

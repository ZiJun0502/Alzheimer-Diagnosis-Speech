 in terms of the design and the project soon grew from 50-50 reavers in about a year. Soon we had upgrown the scrap yards what they could provide, so we co-host a wire manufacturer to help us and we're not only to supply the materials and on bobbins but to produce our callous specification. At the same time I was thinking well there's lots of possibility here to produce content-proof products away from the ethnic a little bit more content-proof. So I developed a whole range around a mass-produced range that obviously put it into a much high-end decor market that could be exported and also service our local market. We started experimenting as you can see in terms of shapes, forms, the scale would become very important and it's become our pit project that's successful, it's been running for 12 years and we supply the comrades' hearts and Donna Karen and so it's kind of great. This is our group, our main group of weavers, they come on a weekly basis to do urban, they all have bank account, they all move back to the rural area where they came from, it's a weekly turnaround of production. This is the community that I originally showed you the slab of and that's also modernized today and it's supporting work for 300 weavers and the base stays at all. Thank you very much!

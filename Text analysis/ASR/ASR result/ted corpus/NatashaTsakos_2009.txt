 Imagine makes us inventors and creators and unique. I was commissioned in 2003 to create an original show and begin developing Upwake. Upwake tells the story of zero, a modern day businessman going to work with his life in a suitcase, stuck between dream and reality and not able to decide for the two. I wanted Upwake to have the same audio visual qualities as a movieward, and I wanted to let my imagination run wild. So I began drawing the story that was moving in my head. If I'll turn the settings with the A.V. the author of the little prince we're here, he would have drawn three holes inside that box and told you your sheep was inside. Because if you look closely enough things will begin to appear. This is not a box. These are the renderings of my imagination from head to paper to screen to life. In Upwake buildings were suits, zero tap dances on a giant keyboard, clones himself with a scanner, tames and whips the computer mice, cells away into dreamscape from a single piece of paper, and launches into space. I wanted to create environments that moved and morphed like an illusionist, but from one world to another in a second. I wanted to have humor, beauty, simplicity and complexity. And use metaphors to suggest ideas at the beginning of the show, for example, zero DJs dream and reality. Technology is an instrument that allowed me to manifest my visions in high definition, live on stage. So today I would like to talk to you about the relationship between theatre and technology. Let's start with technology. Alright, let's start with theatre. Hey!

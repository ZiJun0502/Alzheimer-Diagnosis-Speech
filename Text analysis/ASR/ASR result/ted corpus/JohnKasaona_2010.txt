 I was a little bit of a man. But it is only twice the size of California. I come from a region in the remote north west part of the country. It's called Kunene region. And in the center of Kunene region is the valley of Cess Fondane. This is where I was born. This is where I'm coming from. Most people that are following the story of Angelin Jolly and Brad Pitt were not when an India is. They are from Libya for its beautiful dunes that are even taller than the Bayer State buildings. Wind and time have twisted our landscape in a very strange shape. And this shape, a speckled, was wet left. It has become so adapted to this house and straight lens. I'm a Himbab. As I'm standing, you might wonder why are you wearing these western clothes? I'm a Himbab in an India. A Himbab is one of the 29 ethnic groups in an India. We love a very traditional lifestyle. I grew up hurting looking after our livestock, goat, sheep and cattle. And one day, my father actually took me into the bush. He said, John, I want you to become a good hater. Boy, if you are looking after our livestock and you see a cheetah eating our goat, cheetah is very nervous. Just walk up to eat. Walk up to eat and smack it at the back side. And he will let go of the goat and run off. And then he said, boy, if you run into a lion, don't move. Don't move. Stand your ground. Pa, pa, just look at him in the eye. It may not want to fight you. And then he said, if you see a leopard, boy, you better run right here. Imagine you run faster than those goats you are looking after. And that's why we actually started to learn about nature. In addition to being an out-nated Indian, in addition to being a Himbab, I'm also a trained conservationist. And it is very important, if you are in this, you'll know what to confront and what to run from. I was born in 1971. We left the apartment in the gym. The whites put a gray sand on the ground.

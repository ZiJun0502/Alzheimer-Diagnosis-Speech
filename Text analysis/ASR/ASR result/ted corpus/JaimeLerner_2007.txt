 working in cities for almost 40 years. And where every mayor is trying to tell me all these cities are big, or the other mayor said is that we don't have financial resources. I would like to say, from the experience I have is every city in the world can be improved in less than three years. It's time there's no matter of scale, there's not question of scale, there's not question of financial resources. Every problem in a city has to have its own equation of co-responsibility. And also a design. So, to start, I want to introduce some characters from a book I made for teenagers. The best example of quality of life is the turtle. Because the turtle is an example of living and working together. And when you realize that the cask of the turtle, it looks like an urban tessiture. And can we imagine if we cut the cask of the turtle, how sad she's going to be? And that's where doing in our cities, living here, working here, having a major here. And most of the people are living in a city and living outside the city. So, the other characters auto, the automobile, he's invited for a party he never wants to live. The chairs are on the tables and still drinking, and he drinks a lot. And he cuts a lot. Very agatist, he cares only one or two people. And that's the end. He has always for more infrastructure. Freeways. He's a very demanding person. So, and on the other hand, the podium, the friendly bus, he carries 300 people for 275, is Sweden, 300 Brazilians. Speaking about the design, every city has its own design. Curitiba, my city, 3 million in the metropolitan area, 1 million, 800,000 people in the city itself. Curitiba, Rio, it's like two birds kissing themselves or a sacca, San Francisco is very easy. Market street, Venice and the waterfront.

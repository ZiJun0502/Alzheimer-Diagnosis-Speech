 you have to ride a bicycle carrying your own weight and also some other weight so that you can earn the bread for the day. Well poor do not remain poor they become law of mid class and if they do so then of course the conditions will improve and they start riding on scooters but the challenge is again they do not get much value because they cannot afford anything more than the scooter.

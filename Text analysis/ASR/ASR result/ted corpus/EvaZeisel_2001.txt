 I have my file which is called to do, I have my plans, I have my plans and doing my work like I always did. So this takes care of my age. I want to show you my work so you know what I am doing and why I am here. This was about 1925. All of these things were made during the last 75 years. Well of course I am working since 25, doing more or less what you see here. This is a cast with me, this was an exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art. This is now for sale at the Metropolis Museum. This is still at the Metropolis Museum of Narcosale. This is a portrait of my daughter and myself. There are some of the things I have made, I made hundreds of them for the last 75 years. How I call myself a maker of things. I don't call myself an industry designer because on other things industry designers want to make novel things. Now this is a concept of comics, not a aesthetic concept. The industry design magazine I believe is called Innovation. Innovation is not part of the aim of my work. I make a lot of things, I make things more beautiful, more elegant, more comfortable, then draft the craft. I have so much to say, I have to say what I am going to say. Well to describe our professional advice, we are actually concerned with the playful search for beauty. That means the breakfast for beauty was called the first activity of man.

 will tribal councils had convened and they had discussed things of great national importance like do we like the Budweiser commercial and do we like the nachos and who's going to win but they also talked about which candidate they were going to support and if you go back in time to February 3rd it looked like Hillary Clinton was going to get the democratic nomination and the Reben's polls were sanctioned and go all the way but when we talked to people it appeared that a funnel effect had happened in these tribes all across the United States now what's a tribe? Tribe is a group of about 20 so kind of more than a team 20 to about 150 people and it's within these tribes that all of our work it's done but not just work it's within these tribes that societies get filled that important things happen and so as we surveyed the if you will representatives from various tribal councils that met also known as Super Bowl parties we sent the following email off to 40 newspaper editors the following day February 4th we posted it on our website this was before Super Tuesday we said the tribes that we're in are saying it's going to be Obama now the reason we knew that was because we spent the previous 10 years studying tribes studying these naturally occurring groups all of you are members of tribes in walking around at the break many of you had met members of your tribe and you were talking to them and many of you were doing what great if you will tribal leaders do which is to find someone who's a member of a tribe and to find someone else who's another member of a different tribe and make introductions that's in fact what great tribal leaders do so here's the bottom line if you focus in on a group like this this happens to be a USC game and you were to zoom in with one of those super satellite cameras and do magnification factors and you can see individual people you would in fact see not a single crowd just like there's not a single crowd here but you would see these tribes that are then coming together and from a distance it appears that it's a single group and so people form tribes they always have they always will just as fish swim and birds fly people form tribes it's just what we do but here's the rub not all tribes are the same and what makes the difference is the culture now here's the net out of this you're all a member of tribes if you can find a way to take the tribes that you're in and nudge them forward along these tribal stages to what we call stage five which is the top of the mountain but we're going to start with what we call stage one now this is the lowest of the stages you don't want this okay this is a bit of a difficulty image to put up on the screen but it's one that I think we need to learn stage one produces people who do horrible things this is the kid who shot at Virginia Tech stage one is a group where people systematically sever relationships from functional tribes and then we'll together

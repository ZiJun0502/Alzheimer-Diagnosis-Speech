 environment, it is the landscape, right? And you can have a hundred million of these homes, and it's great because they suck carbon, right? They're perfect. You can have 100 million families or some take things out of the suburbs because these are homes that are a part of the environment. Imagine pre-growing a village, right? Takes about seven to ten years and everything is green, right? So not only do we do the veggie house, we also do the in vitro meat habitat, or homes that we're doing research on now in Brooklyn, where as an architecture office, we're the first of its kind, to put in a molecular cell biology lab and start experimenting with regenerative medicine and tissue engineering and start thinking about what the future would be if architecture and biology became one. So we've been doing this for a couple of years, and that's our lab. And what we do is we grow extracellular matrix from pigs. We use a modified jet printer and we print geometry. We print geometry where we can make industrial design objects, right? Like shoes of other belts, handbags, etc. where no sentient creature is harmed. It's victimless. It's meat from a test tube. So our theory is that eventually we should be doing this with homes. So here is a typical stud wall in architectural construction, and this is a section of our proposal for a meathouse where you can see we use fatty cells, his insulation, sillia for dealing with wind loads and spinked her muscles for the doors and windows. And we know it's incredibly ugly, but you know it could have been an English tutor or a Spanish colonial, but we kind of chose this shape. And there it is kind of grown, at least one particular section of it. We had a big show in Prague and we decided to put it in front of the cathedral so religion can confront the house of meat. That's why we grow homes. Thanks very much. Investment in broadband high-speed internet can help small businesses create new American jobs. Small businesses are being blocked.

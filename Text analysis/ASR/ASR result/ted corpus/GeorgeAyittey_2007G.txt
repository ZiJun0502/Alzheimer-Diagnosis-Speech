 J.M.'s, Chiquati, Andrew, and the other Ted Falus. I call them the Chita Generation. The Chita Generation is a new breed of Africans, who grew no nonsense about corruption. They understand what accountability and democracy is. They are going to wait for governments to do things for them. That's the Chita Generation. An African salvation rests on the backs of these Chitis. In contrast, because we have the hipo generation. The hipo generation are the ruling elites. They are stuck in their intellectual patch. Complaining about colonialism and imperialism, they wouldn't move one foot. They are not going to reform the economy. They benefit from the rotten status quo. Now, there are a lot of Africans who are very angry. Angry are the conditions of Africa. Now we're talking about the continent, which is not poor. It is rich, mineral resources, natural mineral resources. But the mineral wealth of Africa is not being utilized to lift its people out of poverty. That's what makes a lot of Africans very angry. In a way, Africa is more than a tragedy more recent one. There's another enduring tragedy. Not tragedies. There are so many people, so many governments, so many organizations who want to help people in Africa, they don't understand. Now we're not saying don't help Africans. African Africa is noble. But help in Africa has been turned into a fear of the absurd. It's like they're blind leading the cruelest. There are certain things that we need to recognize. Africa's begging bold leaps. Did you know that 40% of the wealth created in Africa is not here in Brexit here in Africa? That's what the World Bank says. Look at Africa's begging bold. It leaks horribly. There are people who think that we should pay more money, more aid into this bold which leaks. What are the leakages? Corruption alone costs Africa 148 billion dollars a year. Put that aside. Capital flight out of Africa is $82 billion a year. Put that aside. Let's take food and food. Everywhere.

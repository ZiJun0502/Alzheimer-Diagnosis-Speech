 for eight years. Now I have to take off my shoes or boots to get on an airplane. I'll tell you one quick story to illustrate what that's been like for me. There's a true story every bit of this is true. Soon after, Tipper and I left the... ...what else? We were driving from our home in Nashville to a little farm we have for Pimiles East of Nashville. ourselves. I know that sounds like a little thing to you, but... I looked in the rearview mirror and all of a sudden it just hit me. There was no motorcade back there. You've heard of Phantom Limpane. This was a rented Ford Taurus. It was dinner time. We started looking for a place to eat. We were on I-40. We got to exit 238. 11 in Tennessee. God the Exist started looking. We found a Shownies restaurant. Locos family restaurant chain. We went in and sat down at the booth and the waiters came over. We made a big emotion over Tipper. She took our order and then went to the couple of the booth next to us. She lowered her voice so much I had a little strain to her. She said yes, that's former vice president of the Hall of Gore and the sport. The man said he's come down a long way. There's been a series of epiphanies. The very next day continuing the totally true story. I got on a G5 to fly to Africa to make a speech in Nigeria in the city of Legos on the topic of energy. I began the speech by telling them the story of what had just happened the day before in Nashville. I told it pretty much the same way. I just shared it with you. I told them I was going to go to the airport and I told them I was going to go to the airport. I woke up and I went out to get some fresh air.

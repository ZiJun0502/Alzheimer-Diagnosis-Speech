 Can you imagine day and night thinking observing the same star for 20 years is incredible, but we are crazy we do this and I'm not that far I spent about eight months working on this profile Because I've noticed a very small Symmetry in the profile of one of the planet postcards and I thought well Maybe there is a lithium-6 in this star which is an indication that this star has solved with a planet Because apparently you can't have this fragile eyes of the population six in the atmosphere so sound like stars But you have it in in planets master it so if you are treat if you engulf planets Large number of asteroids people have this lithium-6 Eyes that hope in the spectrum of the star so I invested More than eight months just on in the profile of this star and actually it's amazing because I've got Funkels for many reports to start and have you actually seen the planet going into the star Because they thought that if you are in the palace the parents Strong most of what you are doing is actually looking at You might have seen the planet going into the star and I was saying Excuse me what I see is this It's just incredible because nobody understood really I bet there were very few people who really understood what I'm talking about Because this is the indication that the planet went into the star It's amazing What the power of spectroscopy Was actually realized by King Floyd already in 1973 Because they actually said That you can get any color you like In spectrum and all you need is time and money to make your spectro graph Is there number one higher resolution most precise spectro graph on these planet for carbs Which is actually used to detect exosolar planets sound waves in the atmosphere of stars how we get spectra I'm sure most of you know from school physics that is basically splitting the white light any two colors And if you have a liquid hot mass it will produce something which we call continuous spectrum A hot gas is producing emission lines only No continuum and if you place a cool gas in front of hot source You will see certain pattern which we call absorption lines Which is used actually to identify chemical elements in a cool matter Which is absorbing exactly at those frequencies Now what we can do with the spectra We can actually study a line of sites velocities of Cosmic objects and we can also start

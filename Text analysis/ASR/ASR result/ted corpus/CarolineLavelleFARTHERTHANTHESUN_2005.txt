 Anyway, you see her in the tree because he's fantastic and is nice. Mark. I also joined by my partner in cry and Thomas Dolby. The song is called Father Than The Sun. There's one more. I'm strong in the wind that called you, but you did not hear the heaven. You're a plough that needs porous soil, and I have treated you to work to give up flowers. I want nothing to retreat you. Father, God, the sun from me. Father, God, have you been here? And I go north, I guess, so cold my heart is lava, I understand. You are the one worthy. You are not worthy. When you're calculating my spending figures, you cannot see me. You cannot see me. And if I tell myself enough, all the leaders, you are not worthy. I see it freezes over to trap the light. And I am in the dark, and I'm in the dark, and I am in the dark. And I go north, I guess, so cold my heart is lava.

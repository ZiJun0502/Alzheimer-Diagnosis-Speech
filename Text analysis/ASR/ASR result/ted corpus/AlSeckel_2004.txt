 not as what you'd expect, and there's something joyful about it. And it's the same thing with jokes and all these sort of things. So what I'm going to try and do in my lectures, go a little bit further and see if I can violate your expectations in a pleasing way. I mean, sometimes, expectations that have violated are not pleasant, but I'm going to try to do it in a pleasant way, in a very primal way, so I can make the audience here happy. So I'm going to show you some ways that we can violate your expectations. First of all, I want to show you a particular illusion here. I want you, first of all, when it pops up on the screen, to notice that the two holes are perpendicular to each other, these are all perceptual tricks. These are real objects that I'm going to show you. Now, I'm going to show you how it is done. I've looped the film here so you can get a very interesting experience. I want you to see how this illusions constructed and it's going to rotate. So you see that it's an inside out thing. Now, watch as it rotates back, how quickly your perception snaps. OK, now, watch it as it rotates back again, and this is a very bright audience. All right? See if you can stop it from happening, even though you know 100% is true to fang. You can't undo it. What does that tell you about yourselves? We're going to do it again. No doubt about it. See if you can stop it from happening. No, it's difficult. And we can violate your expectations in a whole variety of ways about representation, about shape, about color, and so forth. It's very primal. It's interesting question to ponder why these things, we find these things joyful. Why would we find them, actually? So here's something that Lionel did a while ago. I like these sort of little things like this. Again, this is not an optical trick. This is what you would see. No, it's not a camera cut. It's a perceptual trick. Okay, we can violate your expectations about shape.

 an experiment. Actually it's not really an experiment because I know the outcome. But it's like an experiment. Now before we start, before we start, I need to do two things. One is I want to remind you of what a seven-year-old child sounds like when he plays the piano. Maybe you have this child at home. He sounds something like this. I see some of you recognize this child. Now if he practices for a year and takes lessons, he's now eight and he sounds like this. Many practices for another year and takes lessons now, he's nine. Many practices for another year and take lessons now, he's ten. At that point they usually give up. Now if he'd waited for one more year, you would have heard this. Now what happened? It was not maybe what you thought which suddenly became passionate, engaged, involved, got a new teacher, it buvity or whatever it is. What actually happened was the impulses were reduced. You see the first time he was playing with an impulse on every note. And the second impulse every other note. You can see it by looking at my head. The nine-year-old put an impulse on every four notes and the ten-year-old on every eight notes. And the eleven-year-old won impulse on the whole phrase. I don't know how I got into this position. I didn't say I'm going to move my shoulder over, move my body. And the music pushed me over, which is why I call it one-butt-play. It could be the other butter. You know a gentleman was once watching a presentation I was doing and I was working with the young pianist. He was the president of the corporation in Ohio. And I was working with this young pianist and I said, the trouble with you is you're a two-butt-player. You should be a one-butt-player. And I moved his body like that while he was playing. I needed the music, took off, took flight. There was a gasp in the audience when they heard the difference.

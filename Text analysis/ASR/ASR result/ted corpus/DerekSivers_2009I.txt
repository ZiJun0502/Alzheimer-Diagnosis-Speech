 Blocks have names. Just look at Google Maps here. There's Block 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19. All of these blocks have names. The streets are just the unnamed spaces in between the blocks. And you say, okay, then how do you know your home address? I said, well, easy. This is district eight. There's Block 17, House number one. I say, okay, but walking around the neighborhood, I noticed the house numbers don't throw in order. So of course they do. They go in the order in which they were built. The first house ever built on a block, is House number one. The second house ever built is House number two. Third is House number three. It's easy. It's obvious. So I love that sometimes we need to go to the opposite side of the world to realize assumptions we didn't even know we had and realize that the opposite of them may also be true. So for example, there are doctors in China who believe that it's their job to keep you healthy. So any month you are healthy, you pay them. And when you're sick, you don't have to pay them because they failed at their job. They get rich when you're healthy, not sick. And in most music, we think of the one, as the downbeat, the beginning of the musical phrase, one, two, three, four. But in West African music, the one is thought of as the end of the phrase, like a period at the end of a sentence. So you can hear it not just in the phrasing, but the way they count off the music, two, three, four, one. And this map is also acting. There's a saying that whatever true thing you can say about India, the opposite is also true. So let's never forget whether it's Ted or anywhere else that whatever brilliant ideas you have or hear, the opposite may also be true. Don't want to get those assignments done. Then come on, right after the class we took off C. I got some comments thanks my teacher those are going up hard to see...

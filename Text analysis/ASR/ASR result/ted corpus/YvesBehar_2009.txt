 teenage fashion right there. And I brought this all together. It was passion with alternative energy and raised a solar car across Australia, also the US and Japan. So wind power, solar power, we had a lot to talk about. We had a lot that got us excited. So we decided to do a special project together to combine engineering and design and make a fully integrated product. It's been beautiful. We made a baby. Can you bring out our baby? This baby is fully electric. It goes 150 miles an hour. It's twice the range of any electric motorcycle. Really the exciting thing about a motorcycle is just the beautiful integration of engineering and design. It's got an amazing user experience. It was a wonderful work in the deep behind. It came up with our name and logo with mission motors. And we've only got three minutes, but we can talk about it for hours. Thank you. Thank you, Ted. And thank you for us for having me.

 you'll see that if we give people the information that they need about what's good for them, what's bad for them, if you give them the services that they can use to act on that information, a little bit of motivation, people will make rational decisions and live long and healthy lives. Wonderful. Slightly problematic for me because I work in HIV and although I'm sure that you all know that HIV is about poverty and gender inequality and if you're at TED07 it's about copy prices. Actually HIV is about sex and drugs and if there are two things that make human beings a little bit irrational they are erections and addiction. So let's start with what's irrational for an addict. Now remember speaking to an Indonesian friend of mine, Frank Heaver, who was telling me about when he was in jail in Bali for a drug injection and it was someone's birthday and they very kindly smuggled some heroin into jail and he was very generously sharing it out with all of his colleagues and so everyone lined up all the smack heads in a row and the guy whose whose birthday it was was filled up the the fit and he went down and started injecting people. So he injects the first guy and then he injects his wiping of the needle on his his shirt and injects the next guy and Frank Heaver says you know so on number 22 in line and I can see the needle coming down towards me and there's blood all over the place it's getting blunder and blunter and a small part of my brain is thinking oh that is so gross and really dangerous but most of my brain is thinking please let there be some smack left by the time it gets to me please let there be some left and and then telling me the story Frank he said you know drugs really make you stupid and you know you can't fault him for accuracy but actually Frank he at that time was a heroin addict and he was in jail so his choice was either to accept that really needle or not to get high and there's one place you really want to get high it's when you're in jail but now I'm a scientist and I don't like to make data out of anecdotes so let's look at some data we talked to 600 drug addicts in three cities in Indonesia and we said well so do you know how you get HIV oh yeah by sharing needles I mean nearly 100% yeah by sharing needles and you know where you can get a clean needle or the price you can afford to avoid that oh yeah 100% wrist markets yes we know where to get clean needles so are you carrying a needle we're actually interviewing people on the street in the places where they're hanging out and taking drugs are you carrying needles one in four maximum so no surprises then but the proportion that actually use clean needles every time they inject it in the last week it's just about one in ten and the other

 I'm had a complete specimen of a dodo in their collection up until the 18th century It was actually mummified skin and all but in a fit of space-saving zeal they actually cut off the head And they cut off the feet and they burned the rest in a bonfire if you go look at their website today They'll actually list these specimens saying the rest was lost in a fire Not quite the whole truth anyway The front piece of this article was this photo and I'm one of the people that thinks the Tina Brown was great for bringing photos to the New Yorker because this photo Completely rocked my world. I became obsessed with the object not just a beautiful photograph itself in the color The shallow depth of field of detail. It's visible the wire You can see on the beak there the conservator used to put this skeleton together. There's an entire story here And I thought to myself Wouldn't it be great if I had my own dodo skeleton? And so I Want to point out here at this point that I've spent my life obsessed by by objects and the stories that they tell And this was the very latest one so I began looking around for you see if anyone sold a kit Some kind of model that I can get and I found lots of reference material lots of lovely pictures No dice no dodo skeleton form but the damage had been done I had saved a few hundred photos of dole of skeletons into my creative projects Folded it's a repository for my brain everything that I could possibly be interested in anytime I've an internet connection There's a slew some crew stop moving into there Everything from beautiful rings to cockpit photos the key that the marquee Delaf√© had sent to George Washington to celebrate the storming of the Bastille Russian nuclear launch key the one on the top is the picture of the one I found on eBay the one on the bottom is the one I made for myself Because I couldn't afford the one on eBay Stormtrooper costumes maps in middle earth. That's what I hand through myself There's the dodo skeleton folder this folder has 17,000 photos over 20 gigabytes of information and it's growing constantly and One day a couple weeks later it might have been Maybe a year later. I was in the art store with my kids and I was buying some clay tools We're gonna have a craft table some super sculpting some armature wire some various materials and I looked down at this sculpting I thought maybe Maybe I could make my own dodo skull I Should point out at this time. I'm not a sculptor I'm a hard-edged model maker. You give me a drawing you give me a prop to replicate you give me a crane scaffolding parts from Star Wars especially parts from Star Wars I can do this stuff all day long It's exactly how I made my living for 15 years, but you give me Something like this my friend Mike Renee and sculpting this is a Mac cat for Star Wars episode two This is not my thing. I this is something other people do drag and soft things However, I felt like I had looked at enough photos of dodo skulls to actually be able to understand the topology and perhaps replicate it I mean it couldn't be that difficult so I started looking at the best photos I could find I grabbed all

 There's strong satellites down there the first living things to capture photosynthesis And it's the only place they still occur today Going down there was like entering a time capsule and I came out With a different sense of myself in time The oxygen exhaled by those strong satellites is what we all breathe today Strangatellites are the heroes in my story I hope it's a story that has some resonance for our time It's a story about you and me nature and science Maybe that said I'd like to invite you for a short brief journey of life through time We're in the same space Where matter condenses into spheres over time Solidifying into surface molded by fire Their fire gave way over the merged That this was an alien planet The moon was closer things were different Heat from it in the geysers erupts That is how the oceans were born Water flows around the poles And shake the edges of the earth Water is a key to life and frozen form It is a latent force and it vanishes Earth becomes Mars But this planet is different, it's boiling inside Where that energy touches water Something new emerges life It arises around cracks in the earth Modern minerals become substrates We are bacteria

 You'll have a new understanding and trust in your body. You'll have un-surpast vitality and energy. You'll expand your vocabulary. Meet new people and you'll have a healthier lifestyle. And get this. You'll have an eight-nicification of doing absolutely nothing. You'll eat countless gourmet meals. Flowers will arrive by the truckload. People will say to you, you look great. Have you had any work done? And you'll have a lifetime supply of good drugs. You'll be challenged, inspired, motivated, and humbled. Your life will have new meaning. Peace, health, serenity, happiness, Nirvana. The price? $55,000. And that's an incredible deal. By now, I know you're dying to know what it is and where you can get one. Does Amazon carry it? Does it have the Apple logo on it? Is there a waiting list? Not likely. This gift came to me about five months ago. It looked more like this when it was all wrapped up. Not quite so pretty. And this. And then this. It was a rare gem, a brain tumor, a mandio, a blastoma, a gift that keeps on giving. And while I'm okay now, I wouldn't wish this gift for you. I'm not sure you'd want it, but I wouldn't change my experience. It profoundly altered my life in ways I didn't expect, in all the ways I just shared with you. So the next time you're faced with something that's unexpected, unwanted, and uncertain, consider, that it just may be a gift. I'm gonna say. The precision of a watch is a function of its movement. For Rolex and for Hans Wilton, to guarantee the precision of a timepiece, the pressing question was how to protect the movement itself in the elements, not only water, but also tiny particles of dust. In 1926, a major step was taken with the creation of the world's first waterproof and dust-proof wristwatch. The Rolex Iston was born. Over the years, subtle changes in the design continue to improve the Iston, adding more comfort while keeping this dial contemporary.

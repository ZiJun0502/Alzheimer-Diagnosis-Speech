 for his new office tower, and then left it to a contractor to install these 79 cents, which is behind them. We know instinctively where to reach when we enter a dark room. We automatically throw the little nub of plastic upward, but the sound we are greeted with, as the room is bathed in the simulated glow of late afternoon light. Recalls to mind a dirty men's room in the rear of a Greek coffee shop. This sound colors our first impression of any room. It can't be helped. But where does this sound commonly described as a click come from? Is it simply the byproduct of a crude mechanical action? Or is it an imitation of one half the set of sounds we make to express disappointment? The often-didental consonant of no Indo-European language. Or is it the amplified sound of a synapse firing in the brain of a cockroach? In the 1950s, they tried their best to muffle this sound with mercury switches and silent knob controls. But today these improvements seem somehow inauthentic. The click is the modern triumphant clarion preceding us through life, announcing our entry into every lightless room. The sound made flicking a wall switch off is of a completely different nature. It has a deep melancholy ring. Children don't like it. It's why they leave lights on around the house. Adults find it comforting. But wouldn't it be an easy matter to wire a wall switch so that it triggers the muted horn of a steamship or the recorded crowing of a rooster or the distant peel of thunder? Thomas Edison went through thousands of unlikely substances before he came upon the right one for the filament of his electric light bulb. Why have we settled so quickly for the sound of its switch? Let's see in one. And the next story is called in praise of the tax payer. That so many of the city's most venerable taxpayers have survived yet another commercial building boom is caused for celebration.

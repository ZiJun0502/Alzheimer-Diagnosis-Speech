 she dances. Now he, the guy takes all of his in figuring, honestly, geez, what are my chances? And he could say, oh my god, or I hurt you. I'm laughing out loud. I want to give you a hug, but he comes up with that, you know? He tells her, I'd like to handpink you portrait on a coffee mug. Put a crab inside it, add some water, seven different salts. He means he's got this sudden notion to stand on dry land, but just panhandle it the ocean. He says, you look like a mermaid, but you walk like a waltz. And the girl goes, what? So the guy replies, yeah, I know, I know. I think my heartbeat might be the Moris code for inappropriate. At least that's how it seems. I'm like a junior varsity cheerleader sometimes for swearing, awkward silences, and very simple rhyme schemes. Right now, talking to you, I'm not even really a guy. I'm a monkey. Low in kisses. Add a butterfly, but I'm still suggesting you and I should meet first soon. And then a lot. I'm thinking the Southwest corner of 1542nd at noon tomorrow, but I'll stay until you show up ponytail or not. Hell ponytail alone. I don't know what else to tell you. I got a pencil you can borrow. You can put it in your phone. But the girl does not bunch. Does not smile. Does not frown. She just says, no, thank you. You know. The old new BMW X6.

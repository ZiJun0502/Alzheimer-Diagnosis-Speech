 many years of living in France and learning, you know, studying and working. He returned home and he was asked, what did you produce? What have you done with so many years of being away? And he sort of he showed a handful of figurines and obviously people were, is this what you spent years doing and we were expected huge masterpieces. And what struck me is the understanding that in those little pieces where the combination of a man's life, search, thought and everything just a reduced small version. In a way I feel like that, I feel like I'm coming home to talk about what I've been out we're doing for 20 years now and I will start with a brief tester of what I've been about, handful of films, nothing much to feature films and a handful of short films. But we'll go with the first piece. I destroy lives. Mum said, nothing I, she's not from my real mum. My real mum and dad don't be fucked off back to Nigeria. Devil is in meacle. Have you ever been? Well. Nigeria. Never. Mum wanted to. Good and old. Wish I could. I'd be spending that be happy there. I just everyone can return me. I wonder if you would have been. You don't need me.

It feeds my mind and my soul. Arguing with you is a waste of time, Marcus.

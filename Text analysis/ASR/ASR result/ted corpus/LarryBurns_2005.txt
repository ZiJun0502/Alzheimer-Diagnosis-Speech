 We really have to ask the question, can the world sustain that number of automobiles? And if you look at projections over the next 10 to 15 to 20 years, it looks like the world car park could grow to on the order of 1.1 billion vehicles. Now, if you park those end to end and wrap them around the earth, that would stretch around the earth 125 times. Now, we've made great progress with automobile technology over the last 100 years. Those are dramatically cleaner, dramatically safer, more efficient and radically more affordable than they were 100 years ago. But the fact remains, the fundamental DNA of the automobile has stayed pretty much the same. If we were going to reinvent the automobile today, rather than 100 years ago, knowing what we know about the issues associated with our product and about the technologies that exist today, what would we do? We wanted something that was really affordable. The fuel cell looked great. One tenth is many moving parts in a fuel cell propulsion system as an internal combustion engine in an immense just water. And we wanted to take advantage of Moore's law with electronic controls and software. And we absolutely wanted our car to be connected. So we embarked upon the reinvention of on the molecular chemical engine, the fuel cell, hydrogen as the energy carrier. First was autonomy. Autonomy really set the vision for where we wanted to head. We embodied all of the key components of the fuel cell propulsion system. We then had autonomy drivable with high wire. And we showed high wire here at this conference last year. High wire is the world's first drivable fuel cell. And we have followed up that now with SQL. And SQL truly is a real car. So if we can run the video... ...we can actually see the fuel cell. And we can see the fuel cell. And we can see the fuel cell. And we can see the fuel cell. And we can see the fuel cell. And we can see the fuel cell. And we can see the fuel cell. And we can see the fuel cell. And we can see the fuel cell. And we can see the fuel cell. And we can see the fuel cell. And we can see the fuel cell. And we can see the fuel cell. And we can see the fuel cell. and we can see the fuel cell. And we can see the fuel cell. And we can see the fuel cell. And we can see the fuel cell. And we can see the fuel cell. And we can see the fuel cell. And you can see the fuel cell, and we can see the fuel cell. And we can see the fuel cell. And we can see the fuel cell. And we can see the fuel cell. And we can see the fuel cell. Do throw them in the hell,이�yse.

 We got into sailplane flying, powerplane flying, and considered the sailplanes as a sort of hobby and fun, but got tangled up with some great professor types who convinced me and everybody else in the field that this was a good way to get into really deep science. As well, this was all going on. I was in the field of weather modification, although getting HD and aeronautics, the weather modification subject was getting started, and as a graduate student I could go around to the various talks that were being given on it, and I could type a ride to these coasts and so on, and everybody would talk to me, but all the professionals in the field hated each other, and they wouldn't communicate. And as a result, I got absolutely unique background in that field and started a company which did more research in weather modification. I had a lot of things to do with it, and I had a lot of things to do with it, and I had a lot of things to do with it. I had a lot of things to do with it, and I had a lot of things to do with it, and I had a lot of things to do with it, and I had a lot of things to do with it, and I had a lot of things to do with it, and I had a lot of things to do with it, and I had a lot of things to do with it, and I had a lot of things to do with it, and I was just trying to do it, and then, manufacturing wouldn't take long to make anything that, that was barnwork. projects and companies slowly grew. The thing that was exciting was in 1976. I suddenly got interested in human-powered airplane because I'd made a loan to a friend of $100,000 or a guaranteed money at the bank. He needed them for the money for starting. Company did not succeed and he couldn't pay the money back and I was the guarantor of the note. So I had $100,000 debt and I noticed that the Kramer Prize for human-powered flight which had been around for 17 years at the time was 50,000 pounds which the exchange rate was just about $100,000. So suddenly I was interested in human-powered flight and did not approach the first thing about ways to make a plane was just like I had been doing in England and not succeeding and I gave it up. The bigger than that there was a simple easy way but then got off on vacation trip.

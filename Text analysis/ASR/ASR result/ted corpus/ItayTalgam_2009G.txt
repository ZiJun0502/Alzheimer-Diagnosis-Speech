 really it's worth it. I would just say to you to talk and teach you the gesture. You have to go out to the world and do this, bring whatever company or whatever you want and you have to tell me it doesn't work. Let's look at the first video. I hope you'll think it's a good example of how many and then speaking to people about how to have the success. Now who should we thank for the success? We obviously the Oxford musicians playing beautifully, Vienna, the Hancock's. They know if you look at it and then you have the clapping audience actually taking part in the music. You know, Viennese audiences usually don't interfere the music. This is the closest to an oriental belly dancing feast that they're getting Vienna. I like for example, Israel where audiences cough every time. You have outdoor rooms, time, gathers to stay, that anyone in the world, people have to have the flu, they go to a doctor, they tell a girl they come to my concerts. So that's a sort of tradition. But Viennese audiences do not do that. Here they go out of the regular just to be part of that to become part of the orchestra and that's great. Audiences like here, yeah, make the event. But what about the conductor? What can you say the conductor was doing? Yes. He was happy. And I also show this senior management, people get annoyed. You come to work, how can you so happy? Something must be wrong there, yeah? But he's spreading happiness. And I think happiness, important thing is this happiness does not come from only his own story and his joy of being. The joy is about enabling other people's stories to be heard at the same time. You have the story of the orchestra, the professional body. You have the story of the audience as a community.

 and of conflicts among them. But every moment of human history, from the Stone Age to the Information Age, from Sumer and Babylon to the iPod and Celebrity Gossip, they've all been carried out every book that you've read. Every poem, every laugh, every tear, they've all happened here. Here, here, here. Perspective is a very powerful thing. Perspectives can change. Perspectives can be altered. From my perspective, we live on a fragile island of life in a universe of possibilities. For many millennia, humans have been on a journey to find answers. Answers to questions about naturalism, transcendence, about who we are and why we are and of course, who else might be out there. Is it really just us? Are we alone in this vast universe of energy and matter and chemistry and physics? Well, if we are, it's an awful waste of space. But what if we're not? What if out there, others are asking and answering similar questions? What if they look up at the night sky at the same stars but from the opposite side? What if the discovery of an older cultural civilization out there inspire us to find ways to survive our increasingly uncertain technological adolescence? Might it be the discovery of a distant civilization and our common cosmic origins that finally drives home the message of the bond among all humans? Whether we're born in San Francisco or Sudan or close to the heart of the Milky Way galaxy, we are the products of a billion-year lineage of wandering stardust. We, all of us, are what happens when a primordial mixture of hydrogen and helium evolves for so long that it begins to ask where it came from. 50 years ago

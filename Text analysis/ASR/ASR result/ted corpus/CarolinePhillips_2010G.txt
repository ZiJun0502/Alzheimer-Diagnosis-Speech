 played with a wooden keyboard tuned like a piano. And the third string is pretty innovative. It's also the only instrument that uses this kind of technique. It activates what's called the buzzing bridge or the dog. So when I turn the crank and I apply pressure, it makes it sound like a barking dog. Okay, so all of this is pretty innovative if you consider that the herty-girdy appeared about a thousand years ago and it took two people to play it, one to turn the crank and another person, yes, to play the melody by physically pulling up large wooden pegs. Okay, so luckily all of this changed a couple of centuries later. So one person can actually play and almost, this is pretty heavy, carry the herty-girdy. The herty-girdy has been used historically through the centuries in mostly dance music because of the uniqueness of the melody combined with the acoustic boombox here. And today the herty-girdy is used in all sorts of music, traditional folk music, dance, contemporary and world music in the UK, in France, in Spain, and in Italy. And this kind of herty-girdy takes anywhere from three to five years. It's made by specializing in fears also in Europe and it's very difficult to tune. So without further ado, would you like to hear it? I didn't hear you, would you like to hear it? Okay. Okay, I'd like to sing in bass, which is the language spoken in the bass country where I live in the region of France and Spain.

 want you to see what I'm doing up here. Anyway, I did this house in Santa Monica and it got a lot of notoriety and in fact it appeared in the point of commonplace which is the slide on the right. This is in Venice. I just show it because I want you to know I'm concerned about context. On the left hand side I had the context of those little houses and I tried to build building that fit into that context. When people take pictures of these buildings out of that context they look really weird in my premises that they make a lot more sense on their photograph or seen in that space. And then once I deal with the context I then try to make a place that's comfortable and private and fairly serene as I hope you find that slide on the right. And then I did a law school for Loyola in downtown LA. I was concerned about making a place for the study of law. And we continue to work with this client the building on the right at the top is now under construction. The garage on the right, the gray structure will be torn down finally and several small classrooms will be placed along this avenue that we've created this campus. It all related to the clients and the students from the very first meeting saying they felt denied a place, they wanted a sense of place. So the whole idea here was to create that kind of space in downtown. In a neighborhood that was difficult to fit into and it was my theory or my point of view that one didn't upstates the neighborhood, one made accommodations, I tried to be inclusive to include the buildings in the neighborhood where they were buildings I liked or not. In the 60s I started working with paper furniture and made a bunch of stuff that was very successful in blooming dails. We even made flooring, walls and everything out of cardboard. And the success of it threw me for a loop, I couldn't deal with the success of furniture, I wasn't secure enough as an architect and so I closed it all up and made furniture that nobody would like.

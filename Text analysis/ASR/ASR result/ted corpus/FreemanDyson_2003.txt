 that. What they remember is of course the great trial that the Brits were beaten in G1 and that the country was born. And so I agree very emphatically that the pain of childbirth is not remembered, it's the child that's remembered. And that's what we're going through at this time. I wanted to just to talk for one minute about the future of biotechnology because I think I know very little about that, I'm not a biologist. So everything I know about can be said in one minute. What I'm saying is that we should follow the model that has been so successful with the electronic industry that what really turns computers into a great success in the world as a whole is ties. As soon as computers became ties when kids could come home and play with them, then the industry really took off. And that has to happen with biotech. There's a huge community of people in the world who are practical biologists who have dog breeders, pigeon breeders, orchid breeders, rose breeders. People who handle biology with their hands and who are dedicated to producing beautiful things, beautiful creatures, plants, animals, pets. These people will be empowered with biotech and that will be an enormous positive step to the acceptance of biotechnology. That will blow away a lot of the opposition. When people have this technology in their hands, you have to do it yourself, kid. Grow your own dog, grow your own cat. Just by the software you design it, I won't say anymore. You can take it on from there. It's going to happen. I think it has to happen before the technology becomes natural, becomes part of the human condition. Something that everybody is familiar with and everybody accepts. So let's leave that aside. I want to talk about something quite different, which is what I know about. And that is astronomy. I'm interested in searching for life in the universe and it's open to us to introduce a new way of doing that.

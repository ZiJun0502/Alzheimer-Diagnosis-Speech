 natural things in the world, the getting that because we're animals and that we need to eat we're actually as dependent on the natural worlds as our ancient ancestors were and as more of us move into cities more of that natural world has been transformed into extraordinary landscapes like the one behind me the soybean fields in Matagrossa and Brazil in order to feed us these are extraordinary landscapes but few of us have a get to see them and increasingly these landscapes are not just feeding us either there's more of us move into cities more of a serenity need so the third of the annual graincock globally now gets fed to animals rather than to us human animals and given that it takes three times as much grain actually ten times as much grain to feed a human if it's plaster and animal fast that's not a very efficient way of feeding us and it's an escalating problem too by 2050 it's estimated that twice the number of us are going to be living in cities and it's also estimated that it's going to be twice as much nation very consumed so nation's urbanism arising hand in hand and that's going to pose an enormous problem six billion hungry carnivores to feed by 2015 that's a big problem in action to be carried on as we are it's a problem of rate unlikely to be able to solve 19 million hectares of rainforest to last every year to create new arable land although at the same time we're losing an equivalent amount of existing arables of salamization and erosion we're very hungry for fossil fuels to it takes about ten calories to produce every calorie of food that we consume in the west and even though this food that we're producing at great cost we don't actually value it half the food produced in the USA is currently throwing away and to end all of this at the end of this long process we're not even managing to feed the planet properly the billion of us the obese by the further billion staff none of it makes very much sense and when you think that 80% of global trading food now is controlled by just five multinational corporations it's a grim picture as we're moving into cities the world is also embracing a western diet and if we look to the future it's an unsustainable diet so how did we get here and more importantly what are we going to do about well to answer the slightly easier question first about 10,000 years ago i would say as the beginning of this process in the ancient Near East known as the Plutile Crescu because as you can see it was crescent shaped and it was in the soil so firstile and it was here about 10,000 years ago but two extraordinary inventions aggregically

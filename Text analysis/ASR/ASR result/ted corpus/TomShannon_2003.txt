 swinging on an axle that's on two bearings that pass in between across it like this that counterbalance this way so it allows it to to roll and the sphere has that balance property that it always it always sort of stays still and looks the same from every direction but if you put something on top of it it misbalances it and so would tip over but in this case because the interior is free swinging in relation to the sphere it can stand up on one point and then there was a second level to this object which is that it I wanted it to convey some proportions that I was interested in which is the diameter of the moon and the diameter of the earth in proportion to each other I was exploring really early on wanting to make things float in the air and I thought up a lot of ideas this is a sculpture that I made that's it's magnetically levitated thing is it's slightly dangerous and normally it's sort of cordoned off when it's in a museum but it's see if I can manipulate it a little bit without so this is just floating floating on a permanent magnetic field which stabilizes it in all directions except there's a slight tether here which keeps it from going over at the top of its field it serves surfing on a magnetic field at the crest of a wave and that's what supports the object and keeps it stable I think we could roll the tape I have a collection of videos that I took of different installations which I could narrow right this is the sculpture of the sun and the earth in proportions representing that eight and a half minutes that takes light and gravity to connect it to so here's the earth it's a little less than a millimeter that was turned to solid bronze and here's a similar sculpture that's the song at that end and then in a series of 55 balls it reduces proportionately each ball and the spaces between them reduce proportionately until you get down to this little earth this is in a sculpture park in Tijon this one is about the moon and then the distance to the earth in proportion also this is a little stone ball floating as you see the little feather but it's also magnetically levitated and then

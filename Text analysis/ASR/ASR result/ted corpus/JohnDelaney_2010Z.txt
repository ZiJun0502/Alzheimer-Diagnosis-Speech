 Almond O'Cala. Bassho was a brilliant man. He said more with less than any human that I have ever read for a cocktail. Bassho in 17th-Celebrity, Jux-Depos, a turbulent ocean driven by a storm now passed and captured the almost impossible beauty of our home galaxy with millions of stars, probably hundreds and hundreds who knows how many planets, maybe even an ocean that we will probably call Sylvie in time. As he was nearing his death, his disciples and followers kept asking him, what's the secret? How can you make hype complements so beautiful, so easily? And toward the end he said, if you would know the pine tree, go to the pine tree. What is it? Sylvia has said we must use every capacity we have in order to know the oceans. If we would know the oceans, we must go to the ocean. And what I like to talk to you today about a little bit is really transforming the relationship or the interplay between humans and oceans with a new capability that is not at all routine yet. I hope it will be. There are a few key points. One of them is the oceans are central to the quality of life on Earth. Another is that there are bold new ways of studying oceans that we have not used well yet. And the last is that these bold new ways that we are exploring as a community will transform the way we look at our planet, our oceans and eventually how we manage. Probably the entire planet. So what scientists do when they begin is to start with the system. They define what the system is. The system isn't just a big day. It's not the cure-all-art. It's not even the entire Pacific. It's the whole planet. The entire planet, continents and oceans together. That's the system. And basically our challenge is to optimize the benefits and mitigate the risks of living on a planet that's driven by only two processes, two sources of energy, one of which is solar. It drives winds

 to this conference, brought several CEOs and leaders of some of the companies here in the Silicon Valley to have breakfast with me or with them. And I was so stimulating and had such I-opening experience to hear them talk about the world that is yet to come through technology and science. I know that we're near the end of this conference and some of you may be wondering why they have a speaker from the field of religion. Richard can answer that because he made that decision. Some years ago I was on an elevator and pulled out there coming down. I was to address a conference at a hotel. And on that elevator, a man said, I hear Billy Graham is staying in this hotel. And another man looked in my direction and said, yes, there he is. He's on this elevator with us. This man looked me up and down for about 10 seconds and he said, my, what an entire climax. I hope the two won't feel that these two moments with me is an entire climax. After all this tremendous talks that you've heard and dresses which I intend to listen to every one of them. But I was on an airplane in the east some years ago. And the man sitting across the aisle from me was the mayor of Charlotte, North Carolina. His name was John Belk, some of you with probably knowing. And there was a drunk man on there. And he got up out of his seat two or three times and he was making everybody upset by what he was trying to do it. He was slapping the stewardess and pinching her as she went by. And everybody was upset with him. And finally John Belk said, you know who's sitting here? The man said, no, he said it's Billy Graham, the preacher. He said, you don't say. And he turned to me and he said, put her there. He said, your sermons have certainly helped me. And I suppose that's true with thousands of people. I know that as you have been peering into the future and as we've heard some of it here tonight.

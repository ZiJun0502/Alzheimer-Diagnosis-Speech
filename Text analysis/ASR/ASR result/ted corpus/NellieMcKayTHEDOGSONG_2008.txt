 I was an angry too. Then there was you appeared when I was in town, but with you, I'm fear and nerves jangle, jangle, fur, and moose. And fear were getting me mangled up, I wasn't looking at your eyes, and I was no more a failure. You looked so wacky and wise, and I said, Lord, I'm happy cause I'm just walking my dog, catching some sun. We can't go wrong, yeah, it's just me and my dog, singing our song, strolling along, cause I don't care about your hate, then you're doubted. And I don't care what the politician's about. If you need it, the pan you might just go out to the pound, and find yourself a hound, and make that doggy proud, cause that's what it's all about. My first tragic concern, I was the archetypal loser, I was a pageant gone bad, and then there was you on time, and wagging your tail in the cutest mind, and you was a jail, I said, what's the remind? And you give away, and then I was gone for a long, and I was no more a boozer, but make the happiest home, and I said, Lord, I'm happy cause I'm just walking my dog, singing our song, strolling along, yeah, it's just me and my dog, catching some sun. And I don't care what the politician's about, and we need it, the pan you might just go out to the pound, and find yourself a hound, and make that doggy proud, cause that's what it's all about. That's what it's all about. That's what it's all about. That's what it's all about. That's what it's all about. That's what it's all about. That's what it's all about. That's what it's all about. That's what it's all about. That's what it's all about.

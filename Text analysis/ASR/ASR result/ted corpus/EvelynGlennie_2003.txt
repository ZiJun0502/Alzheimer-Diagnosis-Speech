 aim in life and it sounds quite simple but actually it's quite a big big job because you know when you when you look at a piece of music for example I just look in my little motorbike bag we have here hopefully a piece of music that is full of little black dots on the page and you know we open it up and I read the music so technically I can actually read this I will follow the instructions the tempo markings the dynamics I will do exactly as I'm told and so therefore because I'm a shot if I just play you literally the first maybe two lines or so it's very straightforward there's nothing too difficult about the piece but here I'm being told that the piece of music is very quick I'm being told where to play on the drum I'm being told which part of the stick to use and I'm being told the dynamic and I'm also being told that the drum is without snares snares on snares off so therefore if I translate this piece of music we have this idea and so my career would probably last about five years however what I have to do is a musician is do everything that is not on the music everything that isn't time to learn from a teacher or to talk about even from a teacher but it's the things that you notice when you're not actually with your instrument that in fact becomes so interesting and that you you want to explore through this tiny tiny suffers of a drum so there we experience the translation now we'll experience the interpretation

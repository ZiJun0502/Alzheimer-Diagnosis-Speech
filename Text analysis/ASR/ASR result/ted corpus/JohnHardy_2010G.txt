 It ruined my life. The inconvenient truth and Mr. Gore, I have four kids. And even if part of what he says is true, they're not going to have the life that I had. And I decided at that moment that I would spend the rest of my life doing whatever I could to improve their possibilities. So, here's the world and here we are in Bali. It's a tiny little island 60 miles by 90 miles. It has an intact Hindu culture. Cynthia and I were there. We had had a wonderful life there. And we decided to do something unusual. We decided to give back locally. And here it is. It's called the Green School. I know it doesn't look like a school, but it is something we decided to do and it is extremely, extremely green. The classrooms have no walls. The teacher is riding on a bamboo blackboard. The desks are not square. At Green School, the children are smiling. It's a very unusual thing for school, especially for me. And we practice wholism. And for me, it's just the idea that if this little girl graduates as a whole person, chances are she'll demand a whole world, a whole world to live on. Our children spend 181 days going to school in a box. And we built my school, also built the prison and the insane asylum out of the same materials. So if this gentleman had of had a holistic education, would he be sitting there? Would he have had more possibilities in his life? The classrooms have natural light. They're beautiful. They're bamboo. The breeze passes through them. The natural breeze isn't enough. The kids deploy bubbles, but not the kind of bubbles you know. These bubbles are made from natural cotton and rubber from the rubber tree. So we basically turn the box into a bubble. And these kids know that painless climate control may not be part of their future. We pay the bill at the end of the month, but people that are really going to pay the bill or our grandchildren. We have to teach the kids that the world is not indestructible. These kids did a little graffiti on their desks.

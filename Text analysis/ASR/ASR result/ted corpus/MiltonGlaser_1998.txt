 with a pierro d'Orra Francesca. And it was very difficult for me to imagine how to paint pictures. They were based on pierro. Until I realized that I could look at pierro as nature, that I would have the same attitude to us looking at pierro d'Orra Francesca, because I would if I were looking out a window at a tree. And that was enormously liberating to me. And perhaps it's not a very insightful observation. But that really started me on a path to be able to do a kind of theme and variation based on a work by pierro. In this case, that remarkable painting that's in the Eufizi, the Duke of Montefeltro, that faces his counts sort, a teesta. Once I realized that I could take some liberties with the subject, I did the following series of drawings. That's the real pierro d'Orra Francesca. One of the greatest portraits in human history. And these I'll just show these without comment, but it's just a series of variations on the head of the Duke of Montefeltro. It was a great, great figure in the Renaissance and probably the basis for Machiavelli's prints. He apparently lost an eye in battle, which is why he is always shown in profile. And this is Batista. Then I decided I could move them around a little bit so that the first time in history, they're facing the same direction. Whoops, pass each other. And then a visitor from another painting by pierro is from the resurrection of Christ, as though the cast had just gotten off the set to have a check. And our four large panels, this is upper left, upper right, lower left, lower right. Incidentally, I've never understood the conflict between abstraction and naturalness. Since all paintings are inherently abstract to begin with, it doesn't seem to be an argument. On another subject. I was driving in the country one day with my wife and I saw this sign and said, that is fabulous piece of design. And she said, what are you talking about?

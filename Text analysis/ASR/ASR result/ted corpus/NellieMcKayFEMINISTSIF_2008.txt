 The day with the day shows just like light and up, ladies, We'll be crossed to two ships, sex for money. What's wrong with that? Can't these chicks do anything but wine? Dance, please. Yeah, shall we get off? They sing. Cheap objectification isn't really. It's hot. My whole work and wages work if I can sing a song. On demand, abortion, every city. Okay, but no gun control. One who's women ever get a life. Feminist on ever since of you, More for Hillary. Feminist and vegetarian. Make mine a big one. Feminist, brave, vicious light and ruler. There far too sensitive to ever be a hand. That's why this family is just need to find a man. I'm Dennis Kucinich and I approve Kucinich. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I asked my mother, and she said, I sing in support of anyone. She said, oh, no, just dis everybody except for alternated. I put you in the world how to smile. I could be glad all over the world. I could turn the grayscats to blue if I had you. I could leave the old days behind. Leave me behind.

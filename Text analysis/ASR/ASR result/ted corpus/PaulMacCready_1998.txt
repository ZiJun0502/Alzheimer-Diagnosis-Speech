 things you can change over the next few decades and it's 50-year time bubble you kind of move along in and In that 50 years if you look at the population curve and find population of humans on the earth more than doubles and we're up three and a half times since I was born and when you have a new baby by the time that kid gets out of high school more people will be added than existed on earth when I was born. This is unprecedented and it's big where it goes in the future is Question that's the human part now human related to animals look at the left side of that what I call human portion humans and their livestock and pets versus the natural portion all the other wild animal who just these are vertebrates all the mice derafs Verge setter in land and air not in the water How does it balance? Well certainly 10,000 years ago The civilization is beginning the human portion was less than one tenth of 1% Let's look at it now you follow this curve and you see the wider spot in the middle. That's your 50-year time bubble humans livestock and pets are now 97% of that integrated total mass on earth and all wild nature is 3% we have won the next generation doesn't have to worry about this game. It is over and And the biggest problem came the last 25 years and went from 25% of that 97% And this really is a sovereign picture in realizing we humans are in charge of life on earth. We're like the capricious gods of old week myth have playing with with life and Not a great deal of wisdom injected into it now The third curve is information technology. This is Moore's law plotted here which relates to density of Information but has been pretty good for showing a lot of other things about information technology computers their use internet etc and What's important it just goes straight up through the top of the curve and has no real? Limits to it now the try and contrast these this is the size of the earth going through that same frame and to make it really clear put all four on one graph There's no need to see a little detail words on it that first one is humans versus nature With one there's no more game human population and so if you're looking for growth industries to get into That's not a good one protecting natural creatures human population is going up It's gonna continue for quite a while good business and obstetricians morticians and farming housing etc that all deals with human bodies which require being fed

 And since Richard put me on this whole thing with music, I'm supposed to actually be doing a project with Todd Macover with the MIT Media Lab. It relates a lot to music. But Todd couldn't come in the project just sort of somewhere. I'm not sure whether it's happening the way we've thought or not. But I'm going to explore skill and juggling and basically visual music. I guess. OK, you can start the music. Thanks.

Okay, well, as I sit here and look out, probably a quarter of a mile from here was my childhood home. And I had great memories of growing up on Cadillac Avenue. In fact, after we finish here, I'm meeting a former neighbor who lived across the street, and we are going to have lunch and reminisce about Cadillac Avenue. Every day is different. During the summer of Incident Tuesday morning, I will be doing a fitness class. I will be doing a Tai Chi class in the afternoon.
